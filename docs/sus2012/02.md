我们知道什么是产品经理，我们知道这意味着什么，但是当你在地面上，当你的技术接触到人们，它涉及到城市时，你必须做的是让过程经理或类似的产品经理来管理人们所做的过程，而机器和产品的路线图必须与过程路线图相吻合，因为任何时候我们都要改变任何事情发生在必须改变策略的汽车上，反之亦然。

我认为很多电子商务公司都看到了我们在一个非常深的层面上看到了这一点，因为你知道橡胶实际上是在满足道路，但让团队准备在欧洲推出是我们现在花在巴黎和伦敦的时间。

就像我说的，我们很快就会来到阿姆斯特丹，还有很多其他城市在欧洲排成一排，这将是一个巨大的推动。

> What we see is that actually engagement gets deeper because people have choice they don\'t have to always get the expensive thing so they start using it more often people who maybe wouldn\'t start with the black car products start with taxi or what we call Uber X and then it\'s date night and they will improve.

我们看到的是，事实上，订婚越来越深，因为人们有选择，他们不必总是得到昂贵的东西，所以他们开始更频繁地使用它，他们可能不会从黑色汽车产品开始，从出租车开始，或者我们称之为优步 X，然后它的约会之夜，他们会改进。
