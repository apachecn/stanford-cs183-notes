所以我在想这个演讲，我会说什么对我来说最重要的问题是什么，我们曾经去过的地方，去了哪里，今天开一家公司意味着什么。

我想，你们中的大多数人，尤其是在看完本的演讲后，可能会问，作为一名初出茅庐的企业家，我是如何筹集 1 亿美元的，就像“起床”一样。

所以，让我告诉你，在很早的时候找到一份工作，GET 中心是由我自己创建的，我的联合创始人克里斯想离开。

> Initially there was two of us.

一开始是我们两个人。

> What I did was the design the front end the very that just the visual and the axe.

我所做的是设计，前端，就是视觉和斧头。

> I also did the very back end which is how rails code Access\'s get repositories on disk so I\'m kind of this weird creature and then I do the front end stuff and I do the back end stuff but I\'ve been doing rails for a long time before that and I didn\'t really like it really like rails.

我也做了非常后端的工作，这就是 Rails 代码访问在磁盘上获取存储库的方式，所以我是个奇怪的家伙，然后我做前端的东西，做后端的东西，但是在那之前我已经做了很长时间的 Rails，我不太喜欢 Rails。

> You can tell the world and I actually like rails out much.

你可以告诉世界，我非常喜欢铁轨。

> And so I was through you know being in the Ruby community and going to Ruby meet ups this is how I found my co-founder and Chris Strath was very big into rails he had a blog post that outlined everything about how to be the best Rails developer you can be.

所以，我通过你知道，在 Ruby 社区，去 Ruby 见 Ups，这就是我发现我的联合创始人克里斯·斯特拉斯(ChrisStrath)非常喜欢 Rails，他有一篇博客文章概述了如何成为最好的 Rails 开发人员。

> Everything about it was amazing.

一切都很棒。

> I said this is a guy that I can start a company with because we have complementary skills.

我说这是一个我可以和他一起创办公司的人，因为我们有互补的技能。

但不久之后。

这是一个关于你如何判断你的创业想法是否真的在吸引人的小窍门。

> How is it how do you how can you tell people enjoy it.

你怎么能告诉人们喜欢它。

> One thing that was really effective for us was when people came to us in the private beta phase and they asked Can I pay for this.

对我们来说真正有效的一件事是，当人们来到我们的私人测试版时，他们问我能支付这个费用吗？

> We had no billing system and yet they wanted to pay for it.

我们没有计费系统，但他们却想为此付出代价。

> They wanted to make sure that it would continue to exist so that it would continue to solve their problems.

他们希望确保它继续存在，以便它能够继续解决他们的问题。

> So if you have customers asking you to pay for your company\'s product before you can even sell it to them that\'s a good sign.

因此，如果你的客户要求你在销售公司产品之前支付公司产品的费用，那将是一个好兆头。

> So in order to accomplish this in order to get this company to a place where people could actually buy it.

为了实现这一目标，为了让这家公司能够让人们真正买到它。

> We hired our third co-founder.

我们雇了第三位联合创始人。

> He came on board was just a few months after we had started and he has his first thing built the billing system.

他是在我们开始工作几个月后才上船的，他的第一件事就是建立计费系统。

> PJ Hiatt so now we had two rails guys essentially and misto doing front and back and we\'re building out a better mix of people and skills to accomplish what we need to do to get done.

PJHiatt，所以现在我们有两个 Rails 的家伙，基本上和错误的做前面和后面，我们正在建立一个更好的人员和技能的组合，以完成我们需要做的事情。

> Our first employee that we hired named Scott cone he is a get expert.

我们雇佣的第一位员工叫斯科特·科内，他是一位 GET 专家。

> So we reached a level in the company where we kind of maxed out our knowledge none of us were really get experts and yet we\'re building the site get Hubb which is for hosting get repositories.

因此，我们在公司达到了一个水平，在那里，我们的知识达到了极限，我们中没有人是真正的专家，但我们正在建设一个网站，GET Hubb，它是用来托管 GET 存储库的。

> So again through meet ups we met Scott we talked to him we talked him about product about how he would go about building things and he was the one that built just which is the snippet sharing site.

所以，通过见面，我们遇到了斯科特，我们和他谈了谈产品，我们谈到了他如何去建造东西，而他就是那个建立了一个片段共享网站的人。

他白手起家，把他的知识纳入方程式，这是他的第一项任务。

所以你可以看到，他们聚集了更多的人，他们可以完成更多的事情。

让我们找个能增加这一点的人来。

我们谁也没有做过这么多的生意。

> I\'d done some consulting but that doesn\'t really count.

我做过一些咨询，但这并不算什么。

> None of us had created large businesses.

我们中没有人创造过大企业。

> None of us had an MBA background or a business background like that.

我们都没有工商管理硕士学位，也没有这样的商业背景。

> So none of us either were executives.

所以我们都不是高管。

> None of us had this really broad experience in creating a company that you might as as a person starting out think well how are we going to solve this problem.

我们中没有一个人在创建一家公司方面有过如此广泛的经验，作为一个刚开始创业的人，我们应该如何解决这个问题。

> Well let\'s let\'s hire an executive because they know what they\'re doing.

那么，让我们雇用一名高管，因为他们知道自己在做什么。

> Now you have two problems.

现在你有两个问题。

> Here\'s the thing.

事情是这样的。

> There are executives and they\'re awesome great people but they know so much they know so much that it can be detrimental I think to a startup where you\'re really trying to solve a new problem in a different way.

这里有一些高管，他们都是了不起的伟人，但他们知道的太多了，我认为这对一家创业公司来说是有害的，因为你真的在用另一种方式解决一个新的问题。

> You have to come to problems with beginner\'s mind not knowing something can be a very powerful tool into accomplishing it because you don\'t know that it\'s not possible.

你必须解决初学者头脑不知道的问题，因为你不知道这是不可能的，所以这是一个非常强大的工具。

> That\'s what doing a startup is not realizing that something is impossible and doing it anyway.

这就是为什么创业并不会意识到某些事情是不可能的，而且无论如何都会去做。

> Something else that was a commonality between us the people in get hub in the earliest days was having worked for bad companies before having worked in places where they did things wrong examples of how not to do something are just as good as examples of how to do something.

我们之间的共同之处-最初在 GET 中心工作的人-在他们做错事的地方之前曾为坏公司工作过，如何不做某事的例子和如何做某事的例子一样好。

> And I think this is what companies are for.

我认为这就是公司的职责所在。

> Companies solve problems.

公司解决问题。

> Great companies solve real problems and if you haven\'t ever experienced problems then how can you know what are the right ones to solve.

伟大的公司解决真正的问题，如果你从来没有经历过问题，那么你怎么知道什么是正确的解决方法。

> So you\'re all here to do startups to join startups to create startups.

所以，你们都是来做初创公司的，加入创业公司来创建创业公司。

> I think that if your options are create a startup or try and you know go work for another company going on working for other companies is not so bad because it gives you this really excellent perspective on things to not do actually.

我认为，如果你的选择是创建一家初创公司或尝试，而你知道，去为另一家公司工作，继续为其他公司工作并不是那么糟糕，因为它给了你一个非常好的视角，你可以不去做一些事情。

> So getting experience elsewhere.

所以在其他地方积累经验。

> Not so bad right.

没那么糟吧。

在此之前，许多优秀的创业公司都有大量的全职工作。

有件很棒的事情就是和人们聚在一起，我们总是在一起喝啤酒，我们会讨论我们遇到的问题。

人是非常重要的，对产品的方向有相同的想法是很重要的。

> Getting on the same page for that stuff is going to allow you to push forward.

做同样的事情会让你向前推进。

> If you find yourself in a situation where you\'re not getting along with your cofounders or the very small team that you\'ve created to begin with really step back and evaluate that problem because I don\'t think you can push forward effectively if you\'re fighting each other.

如果你发现自己与你的共同创始人或你创建的非常小的团队相处不融洽，那么你首先要退一步，评估这个问题，因为我不认为如果你们互相争斗，你们就不能有效地向前推进。

看那儿

如果你没有真正想清楚那意味着什么，你就应该和睦相处。

我们很早就雇了一名销售人员，我们不得不让他走，因为他的文化不适合，这是因为我们以前没有这样的招聘经验。

> And that\'s OK.

那也没关系。

> You\'re going to screw up hiring.

你会搞砸招聘的。

> You have to be in a place mentally where you can fix that later on by letting someone go it sucks.

你必须呆在一个精神上的地方，在那里你以后可以通过放某人走来解决这个问题-这太糟糕了。

> Firing people is the worst but if you\'re gonna start a company you have to be the kind of person that can do that when it needs to get done and as your company matures and you go through these different phases things are going to change.

解雇员工是最糟糕的，但如果你想创办一家公司，你必须是那种在公司需要完成时才能做到这一点的人，随着公司的成熟，你经历了这些不同的阶段，事情就会发生变化。

随着时间的推移，你的角色将会发生巨大的变化。

我总是清理东西，修理东西，记录事情进展得如此之快，以至于每隔一段时间就得有人回来修理东西。

> I was the janitor and this I think is why titles are bullshit.

我是看门人，我想这就是为什么头衔是胡说八道的原因。

> Especially in the beginning of a company you just throw all your titles away.

尤其是在一家公司刚成立的时候，你就把你所有的头衔都扔掉了。

> Don\'t even worry about it don\'t bicker about who\'s going to be the CEO or the CTO or the CFO all that stuff is crap.

甚至不用担心这件事，不要为谁会成为首席执行官、首席技术官或首席财务官而争吵-所有这些都是一派胡言。

要尽早把它专门化，还有很多事情要做。

你有合适的性格组合吗。

> So for us I if I look at the different people who are in the company in the early days and why we\'ve been able to stay together as a team all four of us are still there today five years later I\'m sort of the logical pragmatic one of the group.

所以对我们来说，如果我看看早期在公司工作的不同的人，以及为什么我们能够作为一个团队呆在一起-五年后我们四个人都还在一起-我就算是一个合乎逻辑的、务实的团队了。

所以想想当你收集合适的人的时候。

从长远来看，他们是否有合适的组合才能有效，因为这正是你所要追求的。

`[00:11:22]` 所以，一定要想一想，如果你能雇用一个人，每个人都能有效地推动公司前进，他们将如何推动公司前进呢？

`[00:13:52]` 如果你的车很棒，雷，你在后面放了一个大的扰流板，那么你的霓虹灯地面效果就不会那么棒了，因为人们会被扰流板分散注意力。

我们开始说我们用 GET 帮助来构建 GET HOBB，因为它比仅仅获得 Web.com 的产品更多，有些东西你已经看到了，比如工作方面的工作，比如它有点 COM，就像一个更大的产品套件，可以帮助你解决更多的问题。

`[00:17:58]` 但是，在开始的时候，选择一些小的东西，如果你像我们一样引导你，并且你的产品变得流行的话，你实际上可以解决这个问题。
