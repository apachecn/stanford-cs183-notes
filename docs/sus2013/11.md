在 Pinterest 的例子中，你没有发现 SPV 天使的产品，我们每周见面一次，持续四个小时，我主持那个会议，因为很多人认为我没有参与 NSV 天使，或者其他的事情，因为我参与了慈善事业和公民参与。

`[00:13:24]` 我问你，是因为我对罗恩帮助 Y 组合创业公司解决的所有困难问题或大部分困难问题都有一些内在的了解。

所以大部分困难的项目都是资助的，或者在很多情况下，Emeny 交易是我们不宣传活动的地方。

> But but with Pinterest we\'ve with all of our companies in general we always help with a series A round.

但是，有了 Pinterest，我们和我们所有的公司都在一起，我们总是在一系列的 A 轮中提供帮助。

> And then if the company wants it with the on going rounds of financing as well we probably can\'t get into that one even though there is a great one from a hotel room.

然后，如果公司也想要这一轮融资的话，我们很可能无法进入这一轮，尽管酒店房间里有一家很棒的公司。

你对创始人的看法是什么，创始人在筹款中犯的最大的错误是什么，以及展示他们筹款的人的一些最好的品质是什么。

> `[00:14:35]` Well I guess the biggest mistake I see with founders and fundraising is founders are not focusing enough on finding the investor who can add the most value.

`[00:14:35]` 嗯，我想我在创始人身上看到的最大的错误就是创始人没有足够的精力去寻找能增加最大价值的投资者。

> `[00:14:49]` A lot of founders are worried and concerned about valuation and delusion.

`[00:14:49]` 许多创始人对估价和妄想感到担忧和担忧。

> And I think valuation in dilution is secondary to if you can bring in a top tier investor who adds value to this space that you\'re in that\'s worth that\'s worth millions and millions.

我认为，估值稀释是次要的，如果你能引进一个顶级投资者，谁增加了价值，你在这个空间价值数百万美元。

> To your valuation you know in the case of Air B and B that a host of investors trying to invest this is you know it\'s heresy because we had the negotiation in a hotel room when we should have had it where Brian Chesky was staying which is at an Air B and B host location.

对于你的估值，你知道，在 B 和 B 航空的案例中，很多投资者试图投资，你知道这是异端邪说，因为我们在酒店房间里进行了谈判，而当时我们应该有布莱恩·切斯基(Brian Chesky)住在 B 航空公司和 B 航空公司所在地的地方。

> But but what Brian Chesky got that night was oh no we should go with the investor who adds the most value.

但那天晚上布莱恩·切斯基得到的是，哦，不，我们应该和增加价值最多的投资者一起去。

> So Andriessen Horowitz invested a multi billion dollar valuation but there were other investors who even wanted to pay more.

因此 AndriessenHorowitz 投资了数十亿美元的估值，但还有其他投资者甚至希望支付更多。

> And I said to Brian that night hey I think Jeff Jordan at Andreessen Horowitz could do a lot for this company and Brian Chesky for the next year.

那天晚上，我对布莱恩说，嘿，我认为安德森-霍洛维茨公司的杰夫·乔丹(JeffJordan)可以为这家公司做很多事情，而布赖恩·切斯基(BrianChesky)

> Every conversation we had which is often he started with thank you and I go What are you thanking me for.

我们的每一次谈话，他经常以谢谢开始，我走了，你在感谢我什么。

> Thank you for Andriessen Horowitz and Jeff Jordan because Jeff did this this and this today to pick the right investor and not pick a value added investor.

感谢 Andriessen Horowitz 和 Jeff Jordan，因为 Jeff 今天这么做是为了选择正确的投资者，而不是选择增值投资者。

> `[00:16:21]` The other thing is keep the process moving quickly for sure.

`[00:16:21]` 另一件事是确保进程快速进行。

> Get one term sheet a sap.

得到一份学期表。

> So you have a forcing function because investors really don\'t like making decisions as quickly as an entrepreneur needs them to make a decision.

所以你有一个强迫的功能，因为投资者真的不喜欢像企业家需要他们做决定那样快地做出决定。

> So if you can get a forcing function which is basically a term sheet out of anyone then you can truthfully call the other investors and I can call them on your behalf and say we have a term sheet we\'re going to accept in 24 hours.

所以，如果你能得到一个强迫函数，它基本上是任何人的一个术语表，那么你可以如实地给其他投资者打电话，我可以代表你打电话给他们，说我们在 24 小时内会接受一个条款表。

你有学期表吗。

有各种各样的混乱，我们刚才说，嘿，今天，每个人都在 5 点之前提交你的学期报告，或者你没有在竞选，但如果你得到一个学期表，你可以做到这一点。

所以，保持节奏，不要失去动力。

> And then once you get any inkling of an agreement send an email that commits the investor to that agreement.

然后，一旦你对协议有了任何了解，就发送一封电子邮件，让投资者遵守协议。

> Very very important.

非常重要。

> `[00:17:25]` So you\'re not being annoying to follow.

`[00:17:25]` 这样你就不会很烦人了。

> `[00:17:28]` Yeah  `[00:17:28]` it\'s just a short e-mail just confirming dot dot dot.

`[00:17:28]` 是的`[00:17:28]` 这只是一封简短的电子邮件，只是确认点。

> You know and it\'s just confirming that that well in the case of some commitment I am delighted that you committed to invest at 100 million valuation.

你知道，而且它只是证实了这一点，在某些承诺的情况下，我很高兴你承诺以 1 亿美元的估值进行投资。

> My lawyer\'s going to call you tomorrow.

我的律师明天会给你打电话。

> `[00:17:45]` Then it\'s in writing that that investor has committed.

`[00:17:45]` 那么投资者承诺的是书面形式。

> Have you seen over the years we have seen memories many many transactions that fail because somebody doesn\'t remember what they said Think of it happens even more on our emanate transactions.

你有没有见过，多年来，我们看到了很多交易失败的记忆，因为有人不记得他们说了什么，在我们的发散交易中发生得更多。

> You know if we\'re trying to get a company a soft landing and we get the soft landing committed those are the ones that people will try and wiggle out of and a soft landing is when someone gets acquired early on.

你知道，如果我们试图让一家公司实现软着陆，而我们又得到了软着陆的承诺，那么人们就会努力摆脱这些软着陆，而软着陆则是在人们很早就被收购的时候。

> `[00:18:20]` Yeah.

`[00:18:20]` 是的。

> `[00:18:20]` Basically where hey this is not going to be the next Facebook let\'s but we have a great product.

`[00:18:20]` 基本上这不是下一个 Facebook，而是我们有一个很棒的产品。

> Let\'s take that product and make it part of Facebook.

让我们把这个产品变成 Facebook 的一部分吧。

> And when you put Facebook user base with it you know we can fulfill the dream of the product.

当你把 Facebook 的用户基础放在一起的时候，你就知道我们可以实现这个产品的梦想。

> `[00:18:38]` And that\'s where we see people not confirming and getting into trouble.

`[00:18:38]` 那就是我们看到人们不确认和陷入麻烦的地方。

> `[00:18:41]` Yeah.

`[00:18:41]` 是的。

> Correct because there\'s there\'s optionality on transactions like that.

正确，因为这样的交易是有选择性的。

> And in the case of the company the startup needs that transaction to happen so they don\'t end up with the pressure ofPhil.

就公司而言，初创公司需要完成这笔交易，这样他们就不会受到菲尔的压力。

> `[00:18:56]` Yeah.

`[00:18:56]` 是的。

> `[00:18:56]` You don\'t have a whole lot of leverage but I imagine you how you get that area I guess we help out a lot to dig down a little bit in founders again.
