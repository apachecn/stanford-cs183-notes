# Chase Adam at Startup School 2013  

> `[00:00:00]` Hi everyone.

`[00:00:00]` 大家好。

> My name is Chase.

我叫蔡斯。

> And like Jessica said We recently had the privilege of being the first nonprofit to go through Y Combinator.

就像杰西卡说的，我们最近有幸成为第一个通过 YCombinator 的非营利组织。

> So to tell you just a quick one minute about Watsky we\'re a nonprofit crowdfunding platform.

所以，简单地告诉你一分钟关于 Watsky 的事情，我们是一个非营利的众筹平台。

> So the easiest way to think about us is that we\'re basically like Kickstarter for health care around the world so you can go on our Web site see photos and read stories of patients all over the world that need access to low cost high impact medical care but can\'t afford to pay for it.

所以想我们最简单的方法是，我们基本上就像 Kickstarter 一样，在世界各地进行医疗保健，这样你就可以在我们的网站上看到世界各地需要获得低成本、高影响医疗服务的病人的照片和故事，但却付不起钱。

> And you can donate as little as five dollars and directly fund say a lifesaving heart surgery for a 12 year old girl in Nepal or directly fund a prosthetic arm for Hosei a 46 year old man father of five in Guatemala.

你可以捐出 5 美元，直接为尼泊尔一名 12 岁的女孩做一次挽救生命的心脏手术，也可以直接为 46 岁的何赛提供假肢，他是危地马拉的五个孩子的父亲。

> So I spent a lot of time thinking about what on earth I was going to talk about today.

所以我花了很多时间思考我今天到底要讲什么。

> And I thought about all the good starter presentations I\'ve ever heard in my entire life and I realized that every good presentation falls into one of two categories.

我想到了我这辈子听过的所有好的演示文稿，我意识到每一个好的演讲都属于两种类型之一。

> There are informational presentations where really smart people get on stage and tell you that A plus B plus equals startup success.

有一些信息性的演示，让真正聪明的人上台告诉你，A 加 B+等于创业成功。

> And there are motivational presentations where really successful people get on stage until you really funny stories about all the mistakes they made and all the hard lessons they learned on the long road to success.

还有一些励志演讲让真正成功的人上台，直到你看到真正有趣的故事，讲述他们所犯的所有错误，以及他们在通往成功的漫长道路上学到的所有艰难经验。

> And I was really frustrated when realized that I couldn\'t give either one of those two presentations today.

当我意识到我今天不能给出这两个演讲中的任何一个时，我真的很沮丧。

> On the one hand I\'m not experienced or smart enough to have the slightest idea what the formula for startups success is if I did want to be doing ten billion dollars a year.

一方面，我不够有经验，也不够聪明，根本不知道创业成功的秘诀是什么，如果我真的想一年做 100 亿美元的话。

> And on the other hand I\'m not successful enough to tell you funny stories about the lessons I think I\'ve learned because I have absolutely no idea if those lessons are ultimately going to result in success or if they\'re ultimately going to result in failure.

另一方面，我还不够成功，不能给你们讲一些我认为我学到的课程的有趣故事，因为我完全不知道这些课程到底是最终会导致成功，还是最终会导致失败。

> So I procrastinate like crazy two days ago I remember the best startup presentation I\'ve ever heard in my entire life.

所以两天前，我疯狂地拖延着，我记得我一生中听到过的最好的创业演示。

> The best starter presentation I ever heard was when Brian and Nathan of Arabic Inbee came to Y Combinator and told us a story about how Airbnb spent their first thousand days a thousand days searching high and low for product market fit.

我听过的最好的入门演示是，当阿拉伯人 In 蜜蜂的 Brian 和 Nathan 来到 Y Combinator，给我们讲了一个故事，讲述 Airbnb 如何在他们的头一千天里，千里迢迢地寻找合适的产品市场。

> I\'ve never left a presentation more motivated more inspired in my entire life.

在我的一生中，我从来没有离开过比这更有动力的演讲。

> But I had one problem with the presentation.

但我在演讲中有一个问题。

> One nagging thought that I just could not get out of my mind.

一个唠叨的想法，我就是无法摆脱我的脑海。

> And it was that Brian and Nathan and everyone else at Irving B.

是布莱恩和内森以及欧文 B 的其他人。

> They earned their right to come to Y Combinator and tell that story.

他们赢得了来到 Y 组合公司讲述这个故事的权利。

> But I couldn\'t help but go home and wonder how many other startups have persisted for a thousand days or maybe a hell of a lot longer and ultimately failed.

但我还是忍不住回家，想知道还有多少初创公司坚持了一千天，或者可能更久了，但最终还是失败了。

> And that\'s when I realized the one thing I could actually talk about today.

就在那时候，我意识到了我今天能说的一件事。

> The one story I could tell you guys I could tell you our story the story of what Watsky and I can tell it with an honesty that successful people can\'t I can\'t tell you.

我能给你们讲一个故事，我可以告诉你们我们的故事，沃茨基和我能诚实地告诉你们，成功的人不能告诉你们，我不能告诉你们。

> Laughter I can tell you the story of what\'s on our nine hundred and ninety nine day the day before anyone knows if we\'re going to be a massive success or Fergies it\'s going to be a spectacular failure.

笑声，我可以告诉你们我们九九十九天的故事，在没有人知道我们是否会取得巨大的成功或费奇之前，这将是一个惊人的失败。

> So about two and a half years ago I was serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in Central America and I was sitting on the back of a bus right at the Panama Costa Rica border.

大约两年半前，我在中美洲当和平队志愿者，当时我坐在巴拿马、哥斯达黎加边境的一辆公共汽车的后座上。

> And I remember that at that point in my life that bus was the absolute last place in the entire world.

我记得在我生命中的那一刻，那辆公共汽车绝对是世界上最后一个地方。

> I wanted to be.

我想成为。

> `[00:03:25]` It was hot.

`[00:03:25]` 天气很热。

> It was muggy.

太闷热了。

> I was sweating like crazy.

我出汗得像疯了一样。

> There was this old guy sitting next to me that kept kind of like nudging into me.

有个老男人坐在我旁边就像在推我一样。

> And so I was just curling up against the window trying to sleep but the bass was too bouncy so I couldn\'t sleep against the window.

所以我只是蜷缩在窗户上，试着睡觉，但是低音太有弹性了，所以我不能靠窗睡觉。

> `[00:03:39]` I remember I just kept constantly smelling mildew because I\'d been living in the tropics for a year and a half.

`[00:03:39]` 我记得我只是不断地闻到霉味，因为我在热带已经住了一年半了。

> Your clothes never get a chance to dry and I\'m just smelling the mildew coming off the color of my shirt.

你的衣服从来没有机会干，我只是闻到了发霉，从我的衬衫颜色。

> I remember there\'s a black Northface duffle bag at my feet and in that black black Northface stuff duffels every single thing in the world I own.

我记得在我脚边有一个黑色的北面帆布包，在那个黑色的北面布袋里，我所拥有的世界上的每一件东西都是帆布。

> I\'m ten to twelve thousand dollars still in student loan debt.

我还欠学生贷款十到一万二千美元。

> I have another one to two thousand dollars in credit card debt and no hope of paying off until I\'m done with the Peace Corps.

我还有一到两千美元的信用卡债务，在和平队结束之前，我没有还清债务的希望。

> And that\'s not the worst part the worst part is that I just a day before I\'ve gotten off a plane from United States now was back home.

这并不是最糟糕的是，就在我从美国下飞机的前一天，我已经回家了。

> United States I was there from my grandmother\'s funeral while I was there.

当我在那里的时候，我是从祖母的葬礼上来的。

> I caught up with a bunch of my old college and high school friends in San Francisco and I have no idea why I thought this.

我赶上了我在旧金山的一群大学和高中的朋友，我不知道我为什么这么想。

> But  `[00:04:22]` before I saw my friends I figured they were all going to be miserable.

但是`[00:04:22]` 在我见到我的朋友之前，我觉得他们都会很痛苦。

> I was the guy that spent the last five to seven years working with nonprofits traveling around the entire world.

在过去的五到七年里，我一直在和非营利组织一起周游世界。

> I figure they were living the office space life working dead end jobs in cubicles in San Francisco miserable day in and day out.

我想他们过着办公室的生活，在旧金山的小隔间里没完没了地干着没完没了的活。

> But that wasn\'t the case my friends were all happy.

但事实并非如此，我的朋友们都很高兴。

> Every single one of my friend every single of my friends had an awesome apartment.

我的每一个朋友，都有一个很棒的公寓。

> They actually had girlfriends and boyfriends.

他们其实有女朋友和男朋友。

> They went out they got to date.

他们出去约会了。

> They were having fun.

他们玩得很开心。

> But beyond that they were working for companies and building products and solving problems that they cared about.

但除此之外，他们还在为公司工作，制造产品，解决他们关心的问题。

> They were happy they had found a way to do good and do well.

他们很高兴他们找到了做好事的方法，做得很好。

> And in contrast the six years I\'ve spent traveling around the world working with nonprofits it seems slow.

与此形成鲜明对比的是，我花了六年时间在世界各地与非营利组织合作，这似乎很缓慢。

> It seemed bureaucratic it seemed underfunded.

这似乎是官僚主义，似乎资金不足。

> It didn\'t come with the same energy and optimism and innovation that San Francisco had to and so this is a direct quote.

它并没有像旧金山那样充满活力、乐观和创新，所以这是一句直接引用的话。

> But I told every single person I knew my friends and my family when I was back in San Francisco said I\'m done with this.

但当我回到旧金山时，我告诉每个人，我认识我的朋友和家人，我说我受够了。

> That\'s it I\'m not going to sell my soul.

我不会出卖我的灵魂。

> `[00:05:30]` I said I\'m not going to sell my soul but I\'m going to come back to San Francisco and like all of you you\'re going to find a way to do well and do good so there I am sitting in the back of that bus in Central America trying to think about how on earth I\'m going to get there my last five months in the Peace Corps and this woman gets on the bus.

`[00:05:30]` 我说过我不会出卖我的灵魂，但我要回到旧金山，和你们所有人一样，你们会找到一种做得好和做好事的方法，所以我坐在中美洲那辆巴士的后座上，试着思考我在和平队的最后五个月里，我将如何到达那里，而这个女人却上了公共汽车。

> `[00:05:48]` There\'s a picture one of the actual buses woman gets on the bus and she starts asking all these local passengers for donations to pay for her son\'s medical treatment.

`[00:05:48]` 有一张照片，一位真正的女乘客上了车，她开始向所有当地乘客索要捐款，以支付她儿子的医疗费用。

> Now the second I hear that I just tune her out and stop listening.

现在，我一听到她的声音，我就不听她的话了。

> I\'m immediately skeptical.

我立刻对此表示怀疑。

> People in Central America get on the bus every single day one after another asking for donations.

中美洲的人们每天都上公共汽车，一个接一个地要求捐款。

> Preaching selling products.

推销产品。

> No one ever buys but a few minutes later I notice that this woman is walking down the aisle of the bus toward me and all of the local passengers were getting her money and I could not for the absolute life of me figure out why all of these local people trusted this woman.

没人买过东西，但几分钟后，我注意到这个女人正沿着公共汽车的过道向我走来，所有的当地乘客都在拿她的钱，我无法为我的绝对生命弄明白为什么所有这些当地人都信任这个女人。

> Well they had never trusted all the women that came before and it turns out that these people trusted this woman because she had her son\'s medical record with her.

他们从来没有信任过所有以前来的女人，结果发现这些人信任这个女人，因为她有她儿子的医疗记录。

> She was passing it around the bus.

她在公共汽车上经过。

> It was in a red folder there grilling her with questions about the doctor or the hospital or the condition.

它在一个红色的文件夹里，问她关于医生、医院或病情的问题。

> And she seemed to earn their trust.

她似乎赢得了他们的信任。

> She got to the back of the bus.

她到了公共汽车的后面。

> I gave her 5n or cloning\'s which is like a dollar because all these local farmers are donating I dont want to be that one stingy gringo that doesn\'t give her any money she gets off the bus and I get goosebumps and I think it\'s crazy that we have websites like Kickstarter or with the click of a button crowdfund really any type of creative project.

我给了她 5N 或克隆，这就像一美元，因为所有的当地农民都在捐赠，我不想成为一个吝啬的外国佬，她不给她任何钱，她从公共汽车上下来，我会起鸡皮疙瘩，我认为我们有像 Kickstarter 这样的网站，或者点击一个按钮，众筹，真的是任何类型的创意项目，这是很疯狂的。

> We have Web sites like donors choose worth a click of a button you crowdfund a classroom project for a student really anywhere in the United States.

我们有像捐赠者这样的网站，选择一个值得点击的按钮，你可以为美国任何地方的学生提供一个课堂项目。

> Why on earth is there not a Web site where we could crowdfund really the most important thing of all which is health care for people that can\'t afford to pay for it right then having been the most jaded I\'ve ever been in my entire life.

为什么在这个世界上没有一个我们可以为大众资金筹集资金的网站，这是最重要的事情，那就是为那些没有能力支付医疗费用的人提供医疗保健，这是我一生中最疲倦的一次。

> Five minutes earlier I decided to start Watsa and decided to name it after the town I was traveling through.

五分钟前，我决定启动 Watsa，并决定以我所走过的城镇的名字命名它。

> `[00:07:25]` When the woman got on the bus so this was my got home.

`[00:07:25]` 当那个女人上了公共汽车，这就是我到家了。

> So this was my little hut in the in the Peace Corps.

这就是我在和平队的小屋。

> I had one outlet one light running water for one hour a day.

我有一个插座，一天一个小时的自来水。

> But for those last 5 months were really the best 5 months of my life.

但过去的 5 个月真的是我生命中最好的 5 个月。

> I just became obsessed like obsessed with Watsky.

我只是迷上了沃茨基。

> All I could do is think about Losey for 10 to 15 hours a day and I would play a game and the game or at play as I would just think up every possible issue or problem or externality that could arise with a Wannsee model and I\'d try to come up with a solution for five months.

我所能做的就是每天想一想洛西 10 到 15 个小时，我会玩一个游戏和游戏，或者在玩游戏的时候，我只会想出每一个可能的问题、问题或外部性，这些问题可能会出现在 Wannsey 模型中，我会尝试找出一个解决方案，持续 5 个月。

> And you guys are probably sounds crazy.

你们可能听起来很疯狂。

> Most of you could probably build Watsa in 2 months and here I am sitting in the middle of nowhere thinking about the idea for 5 months but in retrospect those 5 months for me were some of the most important five months and watches history.

你们中的大多数人可能会在 2 个月内建造 Watsa，而在这里，我正坐在茫茫人海中，思考这个想法 5 个月，但回想起来，这 5 个月对我来说是最重要的五个月之一，也是观察历史的最重要的一个月。

> And the reason for that is that what is that nonprofits are oftentimes is that nonprofits oftentimes need to be a little bit more careful a little bit more skeptical and a little bit more introspective than for profits.

这样做的原因是，非营利组织往往比利润更谨慎、更怀疑、更内省。

> And the reason for that is that with nonprofits it\'s often really really hard to know if you\'re succeeding or if you\'re failing with a for profit.

这样做的原因是，对于非营利组织来说，很难知道你是成功了，还是为了盈利而失败了。

> I envy all of you guys.

我羡慕你们所有人。

> It\'s so simple.

太简单了。

> You build a product.

你制造一个产品。

> If people want that product they buy and they give you money.

如果人们想买那个产品，他们会给你钱。

> The better your product the more money they give you the more people buy it the more you succeed the worse your product the fewer people buy it the less money they give you the less you succeed you can measure success in real time and you can measure success in dollars and cents.

你的产品越好，他们给你的钱越多，购买的人越多，你的产品越成功，你的产品越少，人们给你的钱越少，你的成功就越少，你可以实时地衡量成功，你可以用金钱和金钱来衡量成功。

> Nonprofits are a lot more complicated nonprofits.

非营利组织要复杂得多。

> We have to go to one group of people.

我们得去找一群人。

> We had to convince them to give us money.

我们得说服他们给我们钱。

> We had to turn around 180 degrees take that money and give a product to an entirely different group of people.

我们不得不转 180 度，拿着那笔钱，给一个完全不同的群体一个产品。

> And that\'s where the problem is.

这就是问题所在。

> It\'s really hard to get feedback from that second group of people.

很难从第二组人那里得到反馈。

> It\'s hard because of communication.

因为沟通很难。

> They often speak a different language.

他们经常说不同的语言。

> They\'re living in a really isolated area.

他们住在一个非常偏僻的地区。

> They don\'t have access to internet access to a cell phone maybe they\'re not even literate.

他们无法上网，无法使用手机，也许他们甚至都不识字。

> It\'s also difficult because when you\'re giving people something for free or when you\'re giving people something that\'s heavily subsidized they\'re often really reluctant to give you any negative or critical feedback at all for fear that you\'re gonna stop giving them whatever it is you\'re giving them.

这也很困难，因为当你给别人免费的东西，或者当你给别人一些补贴很大的东西的时候，他们总是不愿意给你任何负面或批评的反馈，因为担心你会停止给他们你所给予的任何东西。

> And it\'s also hard because sometimes you get people things that help them on day one and they end up hurting them on day 365 I remember when I learned this lesson the first time before I was in the peace group I was living and working in Haiti.

这也很难，因为有时人们在第一天就得到了帮助他们的东西，而他们却在 365 天伤害了他们。我记得在我第一次加入和平组织之前，我在海地生活和工作的时候，我学到了这个教训。

> `[00:09:49]` And my third week in Haiti local Haitian friend of mine took me to this outdoor Haitian market got to the market and there\'s 50 plus Haitian women and there are little groups of women and maybe five to seven to a group and they\'re all squatting and kind of like a semicircle.

`[00:09:49]` 我在海地的第三个星期，当地的海地朋友带我去了这个海地的户外集市，那里有 50 多个海地妇女，有几个妇女群体，一个团体可能有 5 到 7 人，她们都在蹲着，有点像半圆形。

> The first group of women bunch of eggs are selling eggs and the second group of women are squatting down and they\'re selling plantains and bananas and my friend taps me on the shoulder and says Chace look at the third group a woman.

第一组是卖鸡蛋，第二组是蹲着卖芭蕉和香蕉，我的朋友拍拍我的肩膀说，查斯看看第三组，一个女人。

> Look at the third group of women there squatting down just the same.

看看第三组女性，同样蹲下。

> But they have white bags coming up in front of them and the top of the bags were rolled down on the front of the bags are an American flag and inside the bags are rice with a little cup to scoop out a cup of rice he said.

但是他们面前有白色的袋子，袋子的顶部是滚动在袋子前面的是一面美国国旗，袋子里面是米饭，有一个小杯子用来舀一杯米饭，他说。

> Those women are selling rice for pennies on the dollar.

那些妇女以一美元卖大米。

> They are selling rice for one one hundredth of what it should actually cost.

他们卖大米的价格是实际价格的百分之一。

> The reason they\'re selling rice for so cheap is that every time there\'s a humanitarian disaster or there\'s a crisis in Haiti what happens is a bunch of nonprofits and a bunch of governments many of them the United States not only go to one group of people they ask for money they take that money they go toU.S.

他们以如此便宜的价格出售大米的原因是，每当海地发生人道主义灾难或危机时，发生的都是一群非营利组织和政府-其中许多是美国政府-不仅仅是他们向一群人索要钱，他们把钱交给了美国。

> companies they buy a bunch of rice they send out rice to Haiti and they give it to people that are starving makes a lot of sense.

他们购买了一批大米，然后把大米送到海地，然后把大米送给饥饿的人们，这是很有道理的。

> The problem is that this has happened so many times that we\'ve flooded the Haitian market with free or heavily subsidized rice he said Chase.

他说：问题是，这种情况已经发生了很多次，以至于我们在海地市场上充斥着免费或大量补贴的大米。

> We\'ve put all the local farmers out of business.

我们让当地所有的农民都破产了。

> How can a local Haitian rice farmer compete with the free products.

当地的海地稻农如何才能与免费产品竞争呢？

> And I remember hearing that story and getting really frustrated and thinking but the problem is so clear.

我记得我听过这个故事，感到非常沮丧和思考，但问题太明显了。

> People are hungry but the solutions and really the whole world really the whole nonprofit world and oftentimes just be really complicated.

人们很饿，但是解决办法，真的，整个世界，整个非盈利世界，还有很多时候，都是非常复杂的。

> So we got back I got back United States after the Peace Corps.

所以我们回来了我在和平队之后回到了美国。

> We put together a volunteer team we were 10 people we had Grace who is in India at the time helping us with marketing.

我们组建了一个志愿者团队，我们有 10 个人，格蕾丝当时在印度，帮助我们做市场营销。

> We had Jesse in Portland doing all of our code.

我们让杰西在波特兰做我们所有的代码。

> We had Howard in South Carolina and all of our finances and we get on a Google Hangout every Tuesday night and we\'d work on quazi.

我们有霍华德在南卡罗莱纳州和我们所有的财务，我们得到谷歌 Hangout 每周二晚上，我们将工作在 Quazi。

> We had no funding no office no salaries no users no revenue and we didn\'t want any of those things we didn\'t care we didn\'t have any desire.

我们没有资金，没有办公室，没有工资，没有用户，没有收入，我们不想要任何我们不在乎的东西，我们没有任何欲望。

> The last thing in the world I wanted to do is build a big nonprofit organization.

在这个世界上，我最不想做的就是建立一个大型的非营利组织。

> We are only doing what because we thought it was cool because we thought it was fun because we wanted to start a nonprofit that we ourselves would donate to.

我们之所以这么做，只是因为我们认为这很酷，因为我们认为这很有趣，因为我们想创办一个我们自己愿意捐赠的非营利组织。

> And in retrospect that being small and being obscure actually gave us a huge advantage.

回想起来，小而晦涩实际上给了我们巨大的优势。

> It enabled us to do whatever we wanted.

它使我们能够做任何我们想做的事。

> We are beholden to no one and we could take risks and we could do things that the big nonprofits could never do.

我们不受任何人的约束，我们可以承担风险，我们可以做一些大型非营利组织永远不会做的事情。

> So doing that year and a half we made five decisions which I think Shape the Future Watsky.

因此，在那一年半的时间里，我们做出了五个决定，我认为这决定了未来的沃茨基。

> The first was you decided to be radically transparent.

第一个是你决定从根本上透明。

> We were going to be the most transparent nonprofit in the world.

我们将成为世界上最透明的非营利组织。

> That means exposing all of our operations all of our financials and even doing extra work to do things like take screenshots of each funds transfer and post them online so people can see exactly where their money is going if they don\'t.

这意味着暴露我们所有的业务，所有的财务状况，甚至做额外的工作来做一些事情，比如对每笔资金的转帐进行截图，并将它们上传到网上，这样人们就能准确地看到他们的钱在哪里，如果他们不这样做的话。

> On our Web site The second thing we did is a hundred percent model if you don\'t Anawat see 100 percent of your donation funds medical care will never take a cut no matter what their thing is.

在我们的网站上，我们所做的第二件事是百分之百的模型，如果你没有看到你的捐赠资金的百分之百，不管他们是什么，医疗服务都不会被削减。

> Third thing is minimal fundraising the third thing we decide as a team is just minimal fundraising we\'ve all seen how operational fundraising can just destroyed nonprofits.

第三件事是最低限度的筹款，作为一个团队，我们决定的第三件事就是最低限度的筹款，我们都看到了运营资金是如何摧毁非营利组织的。

> It is such a distraction there are so many nonprofits out there that get so obsessed and so dependent on fundraising things like annual galas that they forget about why they started that nonprofit in the first place.

这是如此的分散注意力-有那么多的非营利组织如此痴迷，如此依赖于筹款活动，比如年度盛会，以至于他们忘记了为什么他们在一开始就创建了这个非盈利组织。

> We decided we\'re gonna have a circular organizational structure.

我们决定要有一个循环的组织结构。

> What that meant is that there\'s no bosses there\'s no hierarchy.

这意味着没有老板，没有等级。

> There\'s no management and that everyone it wants is responsible to every other person.

没有管理，它想要的每个人都要对其他人负责。

> And we even got rid of founder and co-founder titles.

我们甚至取消了创始人和联合创始人的头衔。

> There are no founders at Watsky.

沃茨基没有创始人。

> We believe what is in a perpetual state of being founded.

我们相信什么是永远存在的。

> It\'s crazy to me.

对我来说太疯狂了。

> Every new person that joins our team brings something completely new.

加入我们团队的每一个新人都带来了全新的东西。

> They changed the entire trajectory of the organization they change the future of Watsky.

他们改变了整个组织的轨迹，他们改变了沃茨基的未来。

> It\'s nuts to think that we\'ve been founded right.

认为我们的成立是正确的，真是疯了。

> We\'re constantly changing.

我们在不断地变化。

> `[00:13:49]` And the last thing we decided was that when ever we were making a decision any decision that impacted our patients or the impact that our donors that we\'d always treat our patients and our donors exactly how we would want to be treated if we were in their specific situation so we worked on Watson for a year and a half every Tuesday built the site for nothing and then spent three thousand dollars to try and get a nonprofit which we did ourselves and got denied and then we figured out a way to get it.

`[00:13:49]` 我们最后决定的是，当我们做出决定时，任何影响到我们的病人的决定，或者我们总是对待我们的病人和捐献者的影响，如果我们处在他们的特殊情况下，我们会怎样对待他们，所以我们每个星期二在沃森身上工作了一年半，毫无意义地建造了这个网站。然后花了三千美元去争取一个非营利组织，我们自己做的，却被拒绝了，然后我们想出了一个办法来实现这个目标。

> But we post it I will never forget the day we launched we launched on August 3rd of 2012 we launched at 9a.m.

但是我们发布了它，我永远不会忘记我们在 2012 年 8 月 3 日发布的那一天，我们在上午 9 点发布。

> in the morning and we sent out an e-mail to our entire network.

早上我们给整个网络发了一封电子邮件。

> Now are thinking okay it\'s going to go crazy now.

现在想，好吧，它现在要疯了。

格蕾丝的妈妈捐了杰西的妈妈捐的。

> Our friends and family slowly donated.

我们的朋友和家人慢慢地捐赠了。

> And then about an hour and a half two hours after we sent out the e-mail that was it.

然后大约一个半小时后，我们发出的电子邮件，就是这样。

> That was our big fancy launch two to two and a half or so.

这是我们最大的幻想发射两到两个半左右。

> That was it.

就这样了。

> And so I said I decided that I wanted to post a hacker news.

所以我说我决定发布一个黑客新闻。

> I\'d never posted a hacker news in my entire life I never even made a comment.

在我的一生中，我从来没有发布过黑客新闻，我甚至从来没有发表过任何评论。

> I was too scared that you were just going to destroy me.

我太害怕你会毁了我。

> But I did.

但我做到了。

> I decided not to tell our team because I figured no one was going to vote.

我决定不告诉我们的团队，因为我想没人会投票。

> And I don\'t want them to all get disappointed.

我不想让他们都失望。

> So my plan was that I would post a hacker news and if I got up as I tell a team but if it didn\'t get up votes I was just going to delete it and pretend like it never happened.

所以我的计划是，我会发布一个黑客新闻，如果我站起来告诉一个团队，但如果它没有获得选票，我只是打算删除它，假装它从来没有发生过。

> And so I posted a hacker news outlet like maybe like a Pisces on there I can\'t see it at 11a.m.

所以我在网上发了一个黑客新闻，就像双鱼座一样，上午 11 点我看不见它。

> that morning and by lunchtime we were the number one post on Hacker News sent 16000 unique visitors to Watsky.

那天早上，到午餐时间，我们是黑客新闻的头号帖子，吸引了 16000 名独特的访客来到沃茨基。

我们几乎立即资助了每一个医疗服务，我们的整个管道。

> We had 189 comments on Hacker News.

我们在黑客新闻上有 189 条评论。

> Hundreds of tweets hundreds of Facebook posts hundreds of e-mails text messages.

数百条推特、数百条 Facebook 发布了数百条电子邮件、短信。
