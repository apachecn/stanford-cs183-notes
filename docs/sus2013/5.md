`[00:01:21]` 我们创建了某种虚拟化行业，它是一层介于硬件和操作系统之间的软件，它伪造了操作系统，以为它运行在硬件上，让您可以在一台计算机上运行多个操作系统，在桌面和服务器上工作，提高效率，使用起来更容易等等。

`[00:05:35]` 我的意思是，我们第一次在 Linux 上开机花了很多小时，我第一次想到在 Linux 上开机大约四个小时，我有点紧张，因为我们会降低性能，但是有一次，我们说服自己，这真的会奏效。

> We went out for angel money which very carefully chose our angels to be people that were very technically sophisticated that would understand what we were doing.

我们去寻找天使的钱，他们非常小心地选择了我们的天使，他们是技术上非常成熟的人，能够理解我们在做什么。

约翰·亨尼西和大卫·谢里丹，因为他们对此非常了解，所以只需要打个电话，你知道，我认为很多天使投资都是这样发生的。

一旦我们走得更远，一旦我们进入市场，我们决定我们需要一条更多的跑道，我们会花更多的钱，我们做一个真正的户外活动，我们决定在那个时候销售产品。

实际上我们正在经历这一轮。

> `[00:07:41]` This was in 2000 and it was sort of the height of the bubble and some seeds found out we were doing around some really great voices and they said what are you doing you should take our money we\'re gonna do it we\'ll give you you know and we said well we\'re gonna we decide we would keep the valuation where it was they could they they were willing to take it higher but we weren\'t and we knew we wanted to go public.

`[00:07:41]` 这是在 2000 年，那是泡沫的顶峰，一些种子发现我们正在做一些非常好的声音，他们说你在做什么，我们应该拿我们的钱，我们会告诉你的，我们会决定，我们会把估值保持在他们可能的水平上我们愿意走得更高，但我们不是，我们知道我们想上市。

> We didn\'t want to ever risk a down round.

我们不想冒任何危险。

> We believed the bubble was going to burst and so we held our valuation and Nate and I kept I didn\'t tell Dell that we were doing.

我们相信泡沫会破裂，所以我们保持了估值，我和内特一直没有告诉戴尔我们在做什么。

> Looking at doing these scenes I just kept that term Shi going and we move forward with the V CS and then in April of 2000 the bubble burst and the VCR called up and said we\'re going to have to have your valuation look what\'s happened everybody\'s have their valuation now and and we were able to say no we don\'t need to do that and we close the round the next day with Dell.

在拍摄这些场景时，我只保留了“史”这个词，我们继续使用 VCS，然后在 2000 年 4 月，泡沫破裂了，录像机打电话给我们，说我们会让你的估值，看看现在发生了什么，每个人都有他们的估值，我们可以说不，我们不需要那样做，第二天我们就和戴尔关闭了。

> `[00:08:44]` It\'s just hard to keep your options open and am we wasn\'t going to say about the funding.

‘

> `[00:08:57]` Oh I couldn\'t say that.

`[00:08:57]` 哦，我不能那么说。

> You know we were so I\'ll get to how we launched and how we got our first idea.

但我只想说，我们是在 Linux 上用我们的产品运行 Windows 的人。

> And Michael Dell who was our lead investor was quoted in CNN as saying I invest in lots of Linux companies none of them are ever gonna make a profit.

美国有线电视新闻网援引迈克尔·戴尔(MichaelDell)的话说，我投资了许多 Linux 公司，其中没有一家能盈利。

> I just want to help Linux and when you\'re a entrepreneur you just don\'t like seeing that in the press.

我只是想帮助 Linux，当你是一名企业家时，你只是不喜欢在媒体上看到这种情况。

> Your company fortunately he was Rog.

你的公司很幸运他是罗格。

非专业投资者的坏处，你知道，但他对我们很有帮助。

> `[00:09:44]` So OK.

`[00:09:44]` 所以好吧。

> `[00:09:45]` So we had money we had a place to live and we we were building our product and this virtualization there was a lot of very deep technology that we had to do but we had to figure out what we\'re gonna be our first.

`[00:09:45]` 所以我们有了钱，我们有了一个居住的地方，我们正在建造我们的产品，我们的虚拟化有很多非常深层次的技术，我们必须做，但我们必须弄清楚，我们将成为我们的第一个。

> You know when you have a giant vision thing you want to do is find a very doable first milestone that creates value for somebody.

你知道，当你有一个巨大的愿景，你想要做的是找到一个非常可行的第一个里程碑，为某人创造价值。

> It could be another company it could be a ideally a customer but it doesn\'t have to be a customer.

它可以是另一家公司，它可以是一个理想的客户，但它不一定是一个客户。

> So what small thing could we do rather than our big vision and we thought well we had this 686 virtualization you know it would be a really great way for someone that was running Linux not you know there were a lot of developers using Linux.

那么，我们能做什么，而不是我们的远大愿景，我们认为我们有了 686 虚拟化，你知道，这对于运行 Linux 的人来说是一个很好的方法，而不是你知道，有很多开发人员在使用 Linux。

> Back then it was just starting to rise.

当时它才刚刚开始上升。

> Linus Torvalds had not quite yet been on the cover of Time though.

然而，莱纳斯·托瓦尔兹还没有上过“时代”杂志的封面。

> And so we would build a desktop product that would let you run Windows on Linux.

因此，我们将构建一个桌面产品，可以让您在 Linux 上运行 Windows。

> And that way we would weave and we could also let Linux run on Windows and we figured that way we could use the Windows device drivers and not have to build every device driver that APC needs and we wouldn\'t have to go into the server market.

这样我们就可以编织，我们也可以让 Linux 在 Windows 上运行，我们认为这样我们就可以使用 Windows 设备驱动程序，而不必构建 APC 所需的每一个设备驱动程序，我们就不必进入服务器市场。

> And we also had a rule that we couldn\'t have a dependency on anybody.

我们也有一条规则，我们不能依赖任何人。

> So we didn\'t want to require Intel Saby 6 architecture to make any concessions for us because that would give us them a lot of power over us and we couldn\'t require Microsoft to make any concessions for our software to run because they would obviously have complete control over us so we set out to build this desktop product that would run Windows on Linux or Linux on Windows but requires zero change for many operating system or chipset vendor and it had to have adequate performance as someone would want to use it.

因此，我们不想要求 Intel Saby 6 架构为我们做出任何让步，因为这将给我们很多权力，我们也不能要求微软为我们的软件运行做出任何让步，因为他们显然对我们有完全的控制权，所以我们着手构建这个在 Linux 或 Linux 上运行 Windows 的桌面产品。但是对于许多操作系统或芯片组供应商来说，这需要零更改，而且它必须有足够的性能，就像某些人想要使用的那样。

> And we set that as our first first milestone.

我们把这作为我们的第一个里程碑。

> And so we kind of got it working.

所以我们让它起作用了。

> And we said OK how do we take it to market.

我们说，好的，我们如何把它推向市场。

> We\'ll take it to market as a Linux tool so that when you want to run you know Mike back then everybody that worked in a company had to run Microsoft Outlook Microsoft Office.

我们将把它作为 Linux 工具推向市场，这样当您想要运行时，您就知道 Mike 了，那时在一家公司工作的每个人都必须运行 MicrosoftOutlookMicrosoftOffice。

> But they wanted to live in a Linux world.

但他们想生活在 Linux 世界里。

> So this was the way to do it without having to have more than one computers or having to dual boot and and so and then the Linux community would be a very technical friendly community for us.

因此，这是这样做的方式，而不必有多台计算机或双引导等，然后 Linux 社区将是一个非常技术友好的社区对我们。

> So that\'s what we did and we launched it.

这就是我们所做的，我们发射了它。

> Everybody thought we were a Linux tool we had three Linux companies come to us and try and buy us and we didn\'t know how much we could charge for that.

每个人都认为我们是一个 Linux 工具，我们有三家 Linux 公司来找我们，试图买下我们，我们不知道我们能为此收取多少钱。

> You got to price your first product.

你得给你的第一件产品定价。

> And so we said well we\'ll just put the data up there we\'ll make it fully functional free.

所以我们说，我们只需要把数据放在那里，我们就可以让它完全免费。

> Anybody can have it over the Internet but they have to.

任何人都可以在互联网上得到它，但他们必须这样做。

> It\'s only a 30 day trial and they can renew it every 30 days if they want to go through the hassle because we really weren\'t sure anybody would pay for it and then we said well if you use it commercially if you\'re using it in a company you should pay two hundred ninety nine dollars.

这只是 30 天的试用期，如果他们想解决麻烦，他们可以每 30 天续订一次，因为我们真的不确定是否有人会为此买单，然后我们说，如果你在一家公司里使用它，你应该支付 299 美元。

> And if you don\'t want to have to renew every 30 days and you\'re just a hobbyist you should pay ninety nine dollars.

如果你不想每隔 30 天续订一次，而且你只是个业余爱好者，你应该付九十九美元。

> So it was this total trust system.

所以这是一个完全的信任系统。

> We didn\'t know how it would work but we just put it up on the internet like that and we had to figure out how to spread the word.

我们不知道它将如何工作，但我们只是把它放在互联网上，我们必须想办法传播这个消息。

> You know when we launched this thing so we decided we would go to a conference that launched startups demo.

你知道，当我们推出这个东西时，我们决定去参加一个启动创业演示的会议。

> And that was a funny anecdote somebody told us we need to hire a marketing person to help us get into demo.
