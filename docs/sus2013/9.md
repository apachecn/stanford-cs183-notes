> `[00:00:06]` We have to sit up straight we have a lower business.

`[00:00:06]` 我们必须坐直，我们的业务较低。

> This is not right.

这是不对的。

Rickover 上将不会容忍这件事。

> OK.

好的

> George.

乔治

> Nick what are you working on.

尼克你在忙什么。

> `[00:00:19]` So we are building a multiplayer programming game for TGB border code.

`[00:00:19]` 所以我们正在为 TGB 边框代码构建一个多人编程游戏。

> So write code Kaddoumi but actually game a game.

所以写代码，Kaddoumi，但实际上是一个游戏。

> `[00:00:25]` So how do you how do you win the game.

`[00:00:25]` 那么你是如何赢得这场比赛的呢？

> `[00:00:27]` So you just beat more and more levels until you\'re an awesome developer.

`[00:00:27]` 所以你只需击败越来越多的级别，直到你成为一个出色的开发人员。

> `[00:00:30]` CS sort of get points somehow for it\'s like competitive learning that you learn about your Greenwall get more points more competitive.

`[00:00:30]` CS 某种程度上得到了分数，因为这就像竞争学习，你了解了你的绿色墙，得到了更多的分数，更有竞争力。

> `[00:00:37]` So there\'s multiplayer so like write code to kill a bad guy.

`[00:00:37]` 这样就有了多人游戏，就像写代码杀死坏人一样。

> Yeah.

嗯

> So the first level you got your guy you go to moving around and you kill another guy.

所以第一层你找到你的人，你四处走动，然后杀了另一个人。

> Right and then you\'re killing dudes.

对然后你就杀了人。

> All right so you\'re motivated.

好吧，所以你很有动力。

> Yeah.

嗯

> You know what is your name what\'s the length of your name as a string.

你知道你的名字是什么\作为字符串你名字的长度。

> Okay that\'s Guben.

好吧那是古本。

> Kill that.

杀了那个。

> Oh yeah we do right away.

哦，是的，我们马上就做。

> It\'s not just badges not gadgets.

这不只是徽章，不是小玩意。

> Is it launched yet.

它发射了吗。

> It is.

它是

> Actually we launched it yesterday.

实际上我们昨天就发射了。

> `[00:01:05]` Well the beta things move faster.

`[00:01:05]` 贝塔的动作更快。

> Check it out.

去看看。

> `[00:01:11]` Did you watch because we told you you were going to be at office hours.

`[00:01:11]` 你看是因为我们说过你会在办公时间。

> Actually no we just a coincidence.

实际上，不，我们只是个巧合。

> `[00:01:16]` It is somehow fortunate because we don\'t have time to prepare.

它是幸运的，因为我们没有时间去准备。

> The launch went crazy.

发射疯狂了。

> `[00:01:20]` Yeah but I got home from that from the dinner last night.

`[00:01:20]` 是的，但我昨晚的晚餐回来了。

> And I get on hang out with these guys and they\'re just at the server terminal control seeing and restarting the server because it\'s under so much load doing now not much better and fortunately we can only serve a certain fraction of the traffic that we\'re getting and that\'s been going on for 24 hours.

我和这些家伙混在一起，他们就在服务器终端控制室，看到并重新启动服务器，因为服务器负荷太大了，现在情况并不好，幸运的是，我们只能服务于我们所得到的流量的某一小部分，而且它已经持续了 24 小时了。

> How did you start working on this.

你是怎么开始做这件事的。

> I wanted to learn to code about a year or two ago.

我想在一两年前学会编码。

> I had been assigned my technical co-founder at my first startup and I tried to code kindom and tried a whole bunch of these and I just couldn\'t stay with it.

在我的第一家初创公司，我被指派为我的技术联合创始人，我试着编写 Kindom 代码，并尝试了很多这样的东西，但我不能再继续了。

> It wasn\'t engaging for me.

对我来说不是订婚。

> And so these guy two co-owners were like hey why don\'t we actually make a game.

所以这些家伙，两个共同的老板，就像嘿，为什么我们不做个游戏呢。

> `[00:01:59]` So you were the original guinea pig.

`[00:01:59]` 原来的豚鼠是你。

> I was they thought you can\'t keep motivated using existing stuff like a game where you can kill people.

我是说，他们认为你不能继续使用现有的东西，比如你可以杀人的游戏。

> `[00:02:07]` You know I was it wasn\'t just that our first startup customers kept coming to us and saying we keep using your your company your product because it\'s like a game and we hadn\'t attended that at all.

`[00:02:07]` 你知道，我不是因为我们的第一批创业客户不断来找我们，说我们一直在使用贵公司的产品，因为这就像一场游戏，而我们根本没有参加过。

> And what was it.

那是怎么回事。

> It\'s a company to teach people Chinese characters.

这是一家教会人们汉字的公司。

> And so we thought well if we can do that inadvertently what would happen if we actually made a game so how far can you learn how to program by like how much can you teach people.

所以我们想，如果我们能不经意地做到这一点，那么如果我们真的制作了一个游戏，你能学会如何编程，比如你能教多少人，会发生什么。

> `[00:02:34]` Right.

`[00:02:34]` 对。

> Because I can remember the kind of crappy programming I did when I was in high school where I didn\'t really understand what I was doing.

因为我能记得我高中时做的那种糟糕的编程，当时我并不真正理解我在做什么。

> So if you look at the stuff that\'s on TopCoder hackery how can you force people to learn advanced concepts when all they really need is to have the right library calls.

所以，如果你看看 TopCoder Hackery 上的东西，你怎么能强迫人们学习高级概念，而他们真正需要的只是拥有正确的库调用。

> Right.

右（边），正确的

> Can you make advanced concepts pretty advanced weaponry.

你能使先进的概念相当先进的武器。

> `[00:02:57]` So the software engineering part of learning to be a developer.

`[00:02:57]` 所以，软件工程是学习成为一名开发人员的一部分。

> That\'s something we can later focus on core programming for now.

现在我们可以把重点放在核心编程上。

> Was you get motivated enough.

你是否有足够的动力。

> Okay.

好的。

> `[00:03:06]` Now I want to build this app but you have to get through different levels right.

`[00:03:06]` 现在我想构建这个应用程序，但是你必须通过不同的级别，对吧。

> Presumably you get more and more sophisticated yet but you could get more and more sophisticated just by writing more and more code and getting access to the right library functions without actually learning any more about programming.

您可能会变得越来越复杂，但是您可以通过编写越来越多的代码和访问正确的库函数而变得越来越复杂，而不必真正了解编程。

> Right.

右（边），正确的

> Couldn\'t you how can you force them to learn more about programming in order to make more powerful weapons so you can have things like Okay your code needs to run this fast.

难道你不能强迫他们学习更多关于编程的知识，以便制造出更强大的武器，这样你就可以拥有这样的东西-你的代码需要这么快地运行。

> `[00:03:28]` And that\'s when you know you don\'t know how to use recursion.

`[00:03:28]` 当你知道你不知道如何使用递归的时候。

> This is the only method of hill you in this one you need to figure out how to do an a function passing method here.

这是希尔的唯一方法，在这里，您需要弄清楚如何在这里执行一个函数传递方法。

> And generally if you make the levels hard enough you\'re able to do when they have a reason to complete it.

一般来说，如果你使水平足够难，你就能做到，当他们有理由完成它。

> They try really hard and you can get them to do harder and harder stuff is a natural progression of the game.

他们真的很努力，你可以让他们做得越来越难，这是比赛的自然进展。

> `[00:03:46]` Have you run beta users through this yet.

`[00:03:46]` 你已经运行过测试用户了吗？

> Quite a few actually.

实际上有不少。

> What did you learn from it.

你从中学到了什么。

> Like what went wrong.

比如出了什么差错。

> `[00:03:51]` Well the first thing that went wrong was that we we started to Heimbach because I had worked in kind of a somewhat technical role and my first startup we assumed a whole bunch of prior knowledge that was totally untrue for our Bayti users.

`[00:03:51]` 错误的第一件事是，我们开始使用 Heimbach，因为我在某种程度上是一个技术性的角色，我的第一家创业公司，我们承担了很多之前的知识，这对我们的 Bayti 用户来说是完全不正确的。

> So you know we started out like you know writing for loops that you\'re like oh well that\'s that simple and then we got people with no programming background and they didn\'t even know how to complete a line like meaning no concept of formal notation is the single biggest obstacle.

所以你知道，我们一开始就像为循环写东西一样，哦，这很简单，然后我们的人没有编程背景，他们甚至不知道如何完成一行，比如，没有形式符号的概念，这是唯一的最大障碍。

> `[00:04:16]` Correct.

`[00:04:16]` 正确。

> `[00:04:16]` What\'s the most advanced concept you\'re teaching now.

`[00:04:16]` 你现在教的最先进的概念是什么？

> `[00:04:19]` So  `[00:04:19]` so far we haven\'t done well where it was like okay you\'re going to need to figure out the targeting strategy if you are taller so you\'re going to find the center of a group of dudes and you\'re you\'re soldiers backed up with artillery half to avoid your shots and you have to make sure they don\'t chase into your like line of shooting.

`[00:04:19]` `[00:04:19]` 到目前为止，我们还没有做得很好，如果你个子越高，你就需要弄清楚瞄准目标的策略，这样你就能找到一群人的中心，而你也是被炮兵一半的炮兵，以避开你的射击，而且你必须确保他们不会像你那样追逐你的射击线。

> `[00:04:35]` What era of technology is this.

`[00:04:35]` 这是什么科技时代？

> `[00:04:37]` What is a web game and you\'re doing everything in JavaScript.

`[00:04:37]` 什么是网络游戏，你用 JavaScript 做所有的事情。

> No no no what.

不什么。

> `[00:04:41]` What era of fantasy.

`[00:04:41]` 什么时代的幻想。

> You\'re a wizard and you\'re casting some control your soldiers and your and your heroes in that sort of thing.

你是个巫师，你在那种事情上控制你的士兵和英雄。

> I see many users that there\'s no Apache helicopters or anything like that.

我看到很多用户认为没有 Apache 直升机之类的东西。

> No unfortunately we don\'t have the magic.

不，不幸的是我们没有魔法。

> All right we\'ve seen do robots we could do when fancy you can make up anything.

好吧，我们见过机器人，我们可以做，当幻想，你可以弥补任何东西。

> Right.

右（边），正确的

> How many users did you guys get.

你们有多少用户。

> `[00:05:06]` So we maxed out the server at 15000 people we had 200 concurrent but we really don\'t know because we were actually people were just getting for 4.

`[00:05:06]` 所以我们在 15000 人的时候把服务器打了个最大值，我们有 200 个并发，但是我们真的不知道，因为我们实际上是 4 的人。

> Why not just open up a bunch more servers.

为什么不多开一堆服务器呢。

> `[00:05:16]` We weren\'t architected that way.

`[00:05:16]` 我们不是那样设计的。

> We didn\'t think we got nearly as much traffic.

我们不认为我们有那么多的交通。

> We just posted it to read it.

我们只是贴出来看的。

> That\'s it.

就这样了。

> `[00:05:20]` Yeah.

`[00:05:20]` 是的。

> `[00:05:21]` We posted it read it and we got swamped parts not even the main or it actually people on the Reddit threads were just like there were repeated things they were saying you know like oh a hug of death hug of death hug of death and you know for for not working so they were scrambling all last night to do that.

`[00:05:21]` 我们发布了它，读了它，我们被淹没了的部分，甚至没有主要或实际上，在 Reddit 线程上的人，就像重复的东西，他们说，你知道，哦，一个死亡的拥抱，你知道，因为没有工作，所以他们昨晚都在忙着去做这件事。

> `[00:05:36]` Do you know if it\'s people that didn\'t know how to program before they\'re mostly doing this or if it\'s just people that want to play a fun game.

`[00:05:36]` 你知道是人们不知道如何编程，然后才开始这么做吗？或者仅仅是人们想玩一个有趣的游戏。

> `[00:05:41]` So the people that know how to program already they\'re like okay when\'s it on get her.

`[00:05:41]` 所以那些已经知道如何编程的人，当她开始编程的时候，他们就像好的一样。

我们什么时候能。

> This is awesome.

这太棒了。

> Who are thinking.

他们在思考。

在接下来的几个月里，开源才能真正地利用这种兴趣。

> But most of the people yeah they\'re on the learn programming so I\'ve read it.

但是大多数人，是的，他们都在学习编程，所以我已经读过了。

> I don\'t know any programming.

我不懂任何程序。

> It\'s great.

太棒了。

> And they don\'t know I wasn\'t really crappy anywhere levels or xenophobes know anything about the gaming business.

而且他们也不知道我在任何地方都不是很差劲，无论是级别还是排外者，都不知道博彩业的情况。

> `[00:06:08]` Like do you know how to make games.

`[00:06:08]` 就像你知道怎么做游戏一样。

> `[00:06:10]` We\'re learning is this is the quick answer there.

`[00:06:10]` 我们正在学习，这是快速的答案。

> OK.

好的

> Because probably certain best practices in the gaming business and probably whatever they do would be to be the starting point.

因为可能是游戏行业的某些最佳实践以及他们所做的任何事情都将成为起点。

> Yeah.

嗯

> So if you\'re wondering how much to open source I don\'t know how much they open source things in their world but whatever they do is probably the default thing to start with.

所以，如果你想知道有多少开源，我不知道他们有多少开放源码的东西在他们的世界，但无论他们做什么，可能是默认的事情开始。

> `[00:06:29]` Yeah we actually that was the first thing we did when we started the company was we realized wow none of us are professional game designers.

`[00:06:29]` 是的，事实上，这是我们成立公司时做的第一件事，我们意识到，哇，我们都不是专业的游戏设计师。

> Let\'s find and talk to game designers so we have we\'ve got this kind of core group of people that are advising us mostly just telling us when we\'ve built sucks but it\'s been very helpful thus far.

让我们找到游戏设计师，并与他们交谈，这样我们就有了这样的核心团队，他们建议我们，主要是告诉我们什么时候建造得很糟糕，但到目前为止，这是非常有帮助的。

> `[00:06:46]` Is there anything they told you that changed what you were doing said make robots and said people understand robots swimming robots.

`[00:06:46]` 他们有没有告诉你什么改变了你正在做的事情，制造机器人，并说人们了解机器人，游泳机器人。

> Because when you have like controlling your units view code people think okay that\'s natural if you\'re robots.

因为当你喜欢控制你的单元，查看代码时，人们会想得好，如果你是机器人，那是很自然的。

> No Siri.

没有 Siri。

> One of the reasons we\'ve if we\'re looking at some someone\'s application and they worked for a long time for a large company that\'s that\'s actually bad to us because like the best startup founders probably could not stand that months that IBM did me in the sophomore year.

如果我们看某个人的应用程序，他们在一家大公司工作了很长一段时间，实际上对我们不利，原因之一就是，就像最好的初创公司创始人一样，他们可能无法忍受 IBM 在大二的几个月里对我做的事情。

`[00:08:28]` 哦，不。

> `[00:08:29]` How are you guys going to make money with this.

`[00:08:29]` 你们怎么才能用这个赚钱呢？

> So it\'s recruitment model basically they\'re the people that the leads that we generate through the coding challenges provide us with the opportunity to qualify people before we even get in touch with a potential company and possibly train these people good enough to make them valuable employees.

因此，它的招聘模式-基本上是我们通过编码挑战产生的领导者-在我们与一家潜在公司取得联系之前，就为我们提供了合格人才的机会，并有可能培训这些人，让他们成为有价值的员工。

> `[00:08:47]` The recruiters we talked to said yes absolutely companies are interested in developers on your site and we\'re interested and so let us know you have something recruiters famously said all sorts of crazy stuff.

`[00:08:47]` 我们交谈过的招聘人员说，是的，公司对你网站上的开发人员很感兴趣，我们对此很感兴趣，所以让我们知道你有一些招聘者常说的疯狂的话。

`[00:10:19]` 所以什么是典型的例子，比如现在推出的最典型的。

> `[00:10:23]` It\'s in private beta right now.

`[00:10:23]` 现在是私人测试版。

> `[00:10:25]` OK.

`[00:10:25]` 好的。

> So what do you anticipate being the typical use case like what sort of thing would people get better at the most common one right now is dancing.

那么，您期望什么是典型的用例，比如人们现在最常见的一种情况下会变得更好，那就是跳舞。

> `[00:10:32]` The reason that the reason for that is because I made a video of myself learning to dance in a year.

`[00:10:32]` 之所以这样做，是因为我在一年内录制了一段自己学习跳舞的视频。

`[00:10:57]` 所以我收到了几百封电子邮件，他们给我打了招呼，因为我看了这段视频，这不是一个了不起的舞蹈演员的视频，而是一个开始不知道怎么做和变得更好的人。

`[00:11:08]` 苏珊看到你在 YouTube 上放的视频，很多人都看了。

> Yeah.

嗯

> So was this what led to the startup.

这就是导致创业的原因。

> Yeah okay so you made this video of yourself learning to dance and then you thought if other people did something like this it would encourage them to dance to.

是的，好吧，你拍了一段你自己学习跳舞的视频，然后你想如果其他人做了这样的事情，会鼓励他们跳舞。

> `[00:11:22]` Yes.

`[00:11:22]` 是的。

> `[00:11:24]` What what sorts of things are people mostly showing themselves besides dance learning.

`[00:11:24]` 除了舞蹈学习之外，人们主要表现出的是什么。

> Why don\'t you accept the rest of the wait list.

你为什么不接受剩下的等待名单。

> `[00:11:58]` Well we\'re working out just like ironing out some kinks in the product and getting it to the stage where we think it\'s going to be really engaging is not engaging enough now well is we got to have some really awesome engagements that well if it\'s engaging enough now you are often out and out enough kinks.

`[00:11:58]` 嗯，我们的工作就像熨平产品中的一些扭结，把它带到我们认为它会真正吸引人的阶段，但现在还不够吸引人-好吧，我们必须有一些非常棒的约会-如果它足够吸引人的话-你现在经常很投入。

> `[00:12:13]` Sure we have I think really the major things that I\'d like to see personally are the kind of social sharing features because when we kind of open the floodgates and have lost most people come onto the platform we want to kind of maximize on that.

`[00:12:13]` 当然，我认为我个人想看到的主要事情是社交分享功能，因为当我们打开闸门，失去了大多数人，我们想要在这个平台上最大限度地发挥作用。

> `[00:12:23]` And you know if a lot of them come on and share and then leave they could have more people come and that.

`[00:12:23]` 你知道，如果他们中的很多人来分享，然后离开，他们可能会有更多的人来。

我们现在不需要新用户，但这只是我想要感觉一切都非常紧凑和良好的用户体验的问题，但它确实有。

`[00:25:46]` 是的，我的意思是，它有乐趣，它的功能版本，它将不得不对你的前三个客户进行住房所有权面试。

不收更多的钱。

> And you know I\'m kind of looking at a little differently where the brokerage is just the way that we enter the much larger logistics space because once I\'m your customs broker I know everything about your supply chain.

你知道，我的看法有点不同，经纪业务正是我们进入更大物流空间的方式，因为一旦我成为你的海关经纪人，我就知道你的供应链的一切。

`[00:27:52]` 是的，好吧，全球的物流产业规模为 2.3 万亿美元。

> No I just mean when you do the customs broker I just like to say the word trillion you know really big markets are bad start ups not good.

不，我只是说，当你做报关经纪人的时候，我只想说一万亿这个字，你知道，真的，大市场都是不好的，创业不好。

`[00:28:35]` 我是说你早些时候说的全美国。

> Customs about business about 3.

海关业务约 3.

> `[00:28:39]` Now I don\'t have exact figures for that but based on the number of shipments that are clear and what people charge for the ship are you going to hire just an army of sales guys and go on that list possibly by asking if we had an army of sales guys and it wasn\'t that fun to manage.

`[00:28:39]` 现在我没有确切的数字，但根据明确的货运量和人们对这艘船收取的费用，你是否只会雇佣一批销售人员，可能会问我们是否有一群销售人员，而这并不是一件有趣的事情。

> But things aren\'t Funder\'s sometimes.

但有时候事情并不是这样的。

> Sometimes it\'s the way to make the most money so I\'m not out to do it better than I did last year so it\'s more fun.
