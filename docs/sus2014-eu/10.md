`[00:17:45]` 所以，当我们谈论创始人的话题时，有人问你，你必须处理的最大的联合创始人争议问题是什么，这是我们看到的打破早期初创企业的最大问题之一。

因此，总的来说，我们在创始人之间看到了很多争议，因为通信因某种原因而中断，这可能是因为一位创始人不像另一位创始人那样坚定。

> It could be that there\'s an imbalance of power between cofound is are causing problems.

这可能是因为两者之间的力量不平衡正在造成问题。

> I mean there can be any number of reasons for it.

我的意思是这有很多原因。

但通常情况下，它回到了沟通，你知道，这是一个压力环境，做一个创业，所以一切都放大，包括你的情感。

而且如此。

`[00:19:20]` 而不是因为他真的和他的联合创始人做了那样的事，所以没有互相憎恨，然后他们打了一段时间，但后来他们还是开了一家公司，最后他们互相憎恨。

> Ideas would continue not having ideas.

思想将继续没有想法。

> `[00:21:54]` Is a little bit counterintuitive because the reason we got into it was we noticed that we accepted a lot of companies who were then partway through a sea change to a different idea.

`[00:21:54]` 有点不合常理，因为我们注意到我们接受了很多公司，而这些公司当时正经历着一场巨变，变成了另一种想法。

每一批。

你知道，他可能多年来一直在研究这个愚蠢的想法，但他们从未启动过 Dropbox。

> `[00:24:22]` And I think I think people there seems to be a myth out there that applying to I see is a one time only chance.

`[00:24:22]` 我认为那里的人们似乎有一个神话，那就是，我认为，申请是唯一的机会。

> And like everybody has said it it\'s not you know we we do welcome reports applications.

就像每个人都说的那样，你不知道我们欢迎报告申请。

> And you know so we take it very seriously.

所以我们非常认真地对待这件事。

> What we are telling people.

我们告诉人们的。

> But the other thing that we hear from founders who have been rejected and.

但我们从被拒绝的创始人那里听到的另一件事。

然后继续重新申请或者不继续报告重新申请是因为他们实际上发现申请和填写申请表的过程和回答问题对他们来说是一个非常有用的方法，让他们对自己的公司有一个清晰的想法。

所以你知道。

> The conclusion in all of this is you have nothing to lose from putting in an application and everything to gain you will be learning something you may get accepted.

`[00:25:14]` 所以你应该在你认识的人那里做

> It\'s actually great those questions are structured in a way to help you think about your company.

事实上，这些问题的结构很好，可以帮助你思考你的公司。

> Yeah I find it pretty useful in itself.

是的，我觉得它本身很有用。

> `[00:25:29]` We actually even had one company that somehow managed to raise money off of the rejected rejection you know and then we funded that for the next batch.

`[00:25:29]` 事实上，我们甚至有一家公司设法从被拒绝的拒绝中筹集资金，你知道，然后我们资助了下一批。

> `[00:25:39]` And so when some of those kind of co-founder relationships that there\'s questions in there about you know the faculty split and the cap table so if you haven\'t yet had that conversation with your co-founder as it\'s kind of a catalyst to do so you have to figure out those issues before you kind of turn in the application.

`[00:25:39]` 所以，当其中一些共同创始人的关系中有一些关于你的问题的时候，你知道教职员工的分裂和帽桌，所以如果你还没有和你的联合创始人进行那种谈话，因为这样做是一种催化剂，你必须在你提交申请之前先弄清楚这些问题。

> So yes and then the next question is how was the first round or how did the first round of nonprofit startups in Y see go.

所以是的，接下来的问题是第一轮怎么样，或者第一轮在 Y 的非盈利初创公司是怎么发展的。

> `[00:26:05]` So for those of you that don\'t know we funded last batch a group of nonprofits and then a year ago we funded what C which was our first nonprofit.

`[00:26:05]` 对于那些不知道我们资助了最后一批非营利组织的人来说，一年前我们资助了 C，这是我们的第一个非盈利组织。

> And again it was another experiment.

这又是另一个实验。

> I think the answer is that it\'s too early to tell.

我想答案是现在说还为时过早。

> And you know with any company with any startup probably a year is not long enough to pick out the real winners.

你也知道，对于任何一家有创业公司的公司来说，一年的时间可能不足以选出真正的赢家。

> So I guess watch this space and see.

所以我想看着这个空间看看。

> I would say that were interested in continuing to fund nonprofits.

我想说的是，他们有兴趣继续为非营利组织提供资金。

> Would encourage any of you guys out there who are interested in starting a nonprofit or are friends or interested to.

会鼓励你们中任何有兴趣创办非营利组织，或者是朋友或感兴趣的人。

> `[00:26:43]` Apply and reach out to us so might break a break.

`[00:26:43]` 应用并联系我们，这样就能打破一次休息。

> The question is Why do you fund nonprofits.

问题是你为什么要资助非营利组织。

> Some people might be thinking.

有些人可能在想。

> `[00:26:51]` Well we don\'t fund them for a start we don\'t need to them so.

`[00:26:51]` 我们不资助他们开始，我们不需要他们这样做。

> So in a way it\'s a way of giving back to the world.

所以在某种程度上，这是一种回馈世界的方式。

> So you know it\'s it\'s our way of helping the world and we look for a specific type of nonprofits as well that we feel will have a really big impact.

所以你知道这是我们帮助世界的方式，我们也在寻找一种特殊的非营利组织，我们觉得这会产生很大的影响。

> `[00:27:09]` So the I think the root of the idea was that we realized that nonprofits actually had a lot of the same issues as the for profits in particular the ones we\'re looking for ones that are very scalable.

`[00:27:09]` 所以我认为这个想法的根源是，我们意识到，非营利组织实际上有许多与利润相同的问题，尤其是我们正在寻找的那些非常具有可伸缩性的问题。

> So we\'re probably not going to fund like the local soup kitchen but something like Watsky essentially does all the same things that our regular companies do they have to acquire users they have a Web site.

所以我们可能不会像当地的汤厨那样投资，但是像 Watsky 这样的公司做的事情和我们的普通公司做的一样-他们必须获得用户-他们有一个网站。

> The only difference is that they\'re a nonprofit.

唯一的区别是他们是非盈利组织。

> So a for profit.

所以为了利润。

> It\'s actually turned out to be really great having them there.

事实证明，有他们在那里真的很棒。

> I think.

我认为

> They gained a lot in that.

他们从中获益良多。

> I actually thought it just brings like a nice energy dynamic to the batch.

实际上我觉得它给这批人带来了一种很好的能量动力。

> They\'re great to have.

他们很高兴有。

> I think they benefit the for profit companies as well.

我认为他们也有利于营利性公司。

> `[00:27:53]` I really like this question it was why is it that all the way the founders seemed to sleep on the floor in tiny apartments.

`[00:27:53]` 我真的很喜欢这个问题，这就是为什么创始人们总是睡在小公寓里的地板上。

> `[00:28:02]` Someone who\'s done that.

`[00:28:02]` 做过那件事的人。

> It\'s practical to live together.

住在一起很实用。

> I mean is one of these pieces of advice I got before why he has to live with your co-founder if that\'s possible.

我的意思是，这是我之前得到的一条建议，如果可能的话，为什么他必须和你的联合创始人一起生活。

> It was hugely beneficial for our company because when you\'re just around each other all the time energy and the point that you generally enjoy being around each other you think.

这对我们公司是非常有益的，因为当你们总是在一起的时候，能量和你通常喜欢和对方在一起的那一点，你都认为。

> `[00:28:21]` Like everything that we did we were like just talking about the company.

`[00:28:21]` 就像我们所做的一切一样，我们只是在谈论公司。

> To echo what\'s been said throughout the day the most productive kind of time in my life because you\'re just around people all the time and it\'s and it\'s not work.

重复我一生中最有效率的一段时间，因为你总是和别人在一起，而这不是工作。

> I guess it never felt to me like work it felt like.

我想这对我来说从来都不像是工作上的感觉。

> I don\'t know another experience that is not work.

我不知道另一种不是工作的经历。

> I think one of the things that you know we look for is people who are.

我想你知道我们要找的人之一。

> `[00:28:44]` Frugal with their resources and we make good use of the resources they have in its source.

`[00:28:44]` 节约他们的资源，我们很好地利用他们的资源来源。

> When you don\'t have any money in the early days and that\'s something that carries on the DNA of the company as you move forward.

当你在最初的日子里没有钱的时候，当你继续前进的时候，这就是公司 DNA 的一部分。

> When we started justA.P my co-founder Mike was sleeping on the balcony actually because we didn\'t have a room.

我们刚开始的时候，我的联合创始人迈克睡在阳台上，实际上是因为我们没有房间。

> So.

所以

> It was it was pretty you know we were doing it on a budget.

很漂亮你知道我们是按预算做的。

> But it was it was good for us.

但这对我们有好处。

> Because you were able to survive this major economic downturn in a couple years later off of not very much capital raised because it kind of like every dollar that we had.

因为你能够在几年后的经济大衰退中幸存下来，因为筹集的资金不多，因为它有点像我们拥有的每一美元。

> We watched pretty carefully.

我们看得很仔细。

> `[00:29:21]` It\'s funny to hear the story but when you\'re actually doing it it\'s not that fun.

`[00:29:21]` 听这个故事很有趣，但当你真的这么做的时候，就没那么有趣了。

> So I think I think it\'s something about also like to reflect back or something because it is tough.

所以我认为这也是一些关于反思的事情，或者是一些事情，因为它很艰难。

> `[00:29:30]` I mean who you know when you\'re growing up what do you want to live with like two or three other people in a very small place because it\'s practical it\'s cheaperetc.

`[00:29:30]` 我是说，当你长大的时候，你知道谁，你想和其他两、三个人一起住在一个很小的地方，因为它很实用，很便宜等等。

> `[00:29:38]` So I think we probably have time for one more so maybe to wrap it up.

`[00:29:38]` 所以我想我们可能还有更多的时间来结束它。

> What is your the one best piece of advice you could give to people who are looking to start a start up or apply to see.

什么是你最好的建议，你可以给那些想要开始创业或申请去看的人。

> `[00:29:52]` So do it now.

`[00:29:52]` 现在就做吧。

如果你 30 岁的话，我想我之前和一些创始人谈过了。

> You have something like 400 months left in your life.

你生命中还有大约 400 个月的时间。

> Let that sink in for a bit.

让它沉入其中一段时间。

> Out of that area here in your 20s you can do the calculation.

在 20 多岁的时候，你可以计算出这个区域。

> What\'s so striking about that concept that 400 months or whatever is that it\'s like very tangible I think to say like thousands of days or weeks or whatever it\'s very hard to understand.

这个概念有什么特别之处，以至于 400 个月或者其他什么东西都是非常有形的，我认为可以说是几千天或几周，或者任何难以理解的东西。

> `[00:30:18]` Like that\'s a real number.

`[00:30:18]` 这是一个真实的数字。

> That is counting down every single month and you don\'t get that time back no matter who you are.

那就是每一个月都在倒数，不管你是谁，你都得不到那个时间。

> So like take action just don\'t end.

所以，就像采取行动一样-不要结束。

> And what that means more practically because you hear that generic advice all the time.

实际上，这意味着什么，因为你总是听到这个一般性的建议。

> For me what it meant in my life was I was working at a company and I saved money and I saved money specifically so I could get a year\'s runway if I didn\'t get funded.

对我来说，这在我的生活中意味着我在一家公司工作，我特别省下了钱，如果我没有资金的话，我就能拿到一年的时装秀了。

> And about six months into it twice you know that was great.

大约六个月的时间，两次，你知道那很棒。

> But like you have to take practical steps to try to see that if you don\'t do it it\'s not going to happen and then don\'t lie to yourself just like stop thinking about startups and do something else.

但是，就像你必须采取实际的步骤，试图看到，如果你不去做，它是不会发生的，然后不要欺骗自己，就像停止思考创业，做其他事情一样。
