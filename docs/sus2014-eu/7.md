`[00:02:03]` 和大多数其他听众一样，我觉得我感觉到了一种相当程度的冒名顶替综合症，那就是台上的人们在演讲，谈论他们的创业和其他一切。

所以我们觉得这是不可能的。

> We brainstormed names and you know we really couldn\'t think of a good one.

我们集思广益，你知道我们真的想不出一个好名字。

> And so it eventually came down to choosing between stripe and Page Daemon and we couldn\'t figure out which of these was a better name and so we decided that if we couldn\'t make up our minds by I think it was December 15th 2011 we just default stripe and December 15th came along and we couldn\'t we couldn\'t choose between them and so strike twice.

所以我们最终还是选择了条纹和页面守护进程，我们不知道哪一个名字更好，所以我们决定如果我们不能下定决心的话，我想是 2011 年 12 月 15 日，我们只是默认了条纹，12 月 15 日出现了，我们无法在两者之间做出选择，所以我们决定，如果我们不能做出决定的话，那就是 2011 年 12 月 15 日，我们只能选择两次。

> And again we just took full advantage of it.

> We were still in invite only private data this time and which meant there was indeed a fairly obvious way to grow faster namely launching and a friend refers to invite only private Boeta as like the baby blanket of startups.

这一次我们仍然只邀请私人数据，这意味着确实有一种增长更快的方式，也就是启动，而一位朋友指的是只邀请私人的 Boeta，就像初创公司的婴儿毯一样。

我认为这是正确的。

> But I will say that the private beta period was really helpful to stripe.

但我要说的是，私人测试期确实对条纹很有帮助。

这对他们来说是一次非常糟糕的经历，如果我们主动接触他们并解决这个问题，他们会很高兴的。

因此，我们更改了代码，以便任何人有任何错误时，都会给公司的每个人发电子邮件，如果他们没有立即做出反应的话。

> Would also phone everyone and just go and fix it and I know what I really mean that like we said we\'d get out of bed if we had to.

`[00:15:51]` 我们还意识到，以工程师为结尾基本上是最好的支持体验，因为它会让人感到沮丧，比如提交一张罚单或发一封电子邮件，而你想知道他们是否真的像这样输入了电子邮件。

> We just added an open chatroom to our Web site where anyone could jump in and start asking questions.

我们刚刚在我们的网站上添加了一个开放的聊天室，任何人都可以跳进来问题。

> And so this ended up being much more productive for us too because you know we could ask clarifying questions and really figure out what the underlying issue was rather I to guess based on the user\'s initial description.

因此，这对我们来说也是更有效率的，因为你知道，我们可以问一些澄清的问题，并真正地找出根本的问题是什么，我可以根据用户的初步描述来猜测。

> It was it was kind of good product developing for us.

对我们来说，这是一种很好的产品开发。

> And then we thought of course why stop there.
