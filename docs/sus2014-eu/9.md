他们觉得自己没有足够的时间去做产前护理，不能相信这样的事情。

所以我们认为，好的，我们可以通过从另一个角度来解决这个问题。

> So we.

所以我们。

> Scaled it all down turn it around and started to build it from again from the bottom up.

把它缩小，把它转过来，然后从下到上重新开始建造它。

> So we scaled down to a consumer product that would slowly start introducing patients to self tracking during pregnancy through an easy to understand emotional experience.

因此，我们缩减到一种消费产品，通过一种易于理解的情感体验，慢慢地开始向患者介绍怀孕期间的自我跟踪。

> `[00:09:55]` So allowing them to include other people also in their prenatal care and their experience of pregnancy.

`[00:09:55]` 允许他们也包括其他人在他们的产前护理和他们的怀孕经验。

> And then we found ourselves before an even greater challenge.

然后我们发现自己面临着更大的挑战。

> Like basically in deep trouble we were building hardware and we were entering one of the most competitive markets right now.

就像我们基本上陷入了严重的麻烦一样，我们正在建造硬件，我们现在正进入最具竞争力的市场之一。

> So that\'s the wearables market.

这就是可穿戴设备的市场。

> `[00:10:21]` We have learned a couple of things about wearables already and that is that we\'re still pretty early on with them.

`[00:10:21]` 我们已经学到了一些关于可穿戴设备的东西，那就是我们对它们的研究还很早。

> And that\'s why it\'s very hard to predict what is the real future for them.

这就是为什么很难预测他们真正的未来。

> But.

但

> Having built something such as a remote patient monitoring system and then scaling it down to a consumer product we kind of came to a thought and maybe a consumer maybe wearables are just that they the consumer products that are paving the way for digitalization in professional health care.

在建立了远程病人监控系统，然后将其缩小到消费产品之后，我们产生了这样的想法，也许是消费者，也许是可穿戴设备，它们只是为专业医疗数字化铺平了道路的消费品。

> The only thing that has to happen is that these devices start providing so reliable data and they become so seamlessly integrated into users wear and lifestyle and habits that they become a part of our everyday life and start transforming the way we take care of our health.

唯一需要发生的是，这些设备开始提供如此可靠的数据，它们会无缝地融入用户的穿着、生活方式和习惯，从而成为我们日常生活的一部分，并开始改变我们照顾健康的方式。

> We also think that pregnancy might be the best entry point for that.

我们还认为怀孕可能是最好的切入点。

> As well that preventive can start minimizing the risks of complications that are becoming more frequent due to consequences of our modern lifestyle such as obesity and sedentary lifestyle and stress.

同样，预防可以开始将并发症的风险降到最低，这些并发症由于我们现代生活方式的后果，如肥胖、久坐的生活方式和压力而变得越来越频繁。

> Well I\'m I\'m very enthusiastic about wearables and changing the health care and how it can transform our lifestyle but.

我非常热衷于可穿戴设备和改变医疗保健，以及它如何改变我们的生活方式，但是。

> I also wanted to touch a little about a little bit the other side of building a startup more exactly how it feels to be a European Founder.

我还想接触一下创业的另一面，更确切地说，作为一名欧洲创始人的感觉。

> And then transferring to the states or more like how to be a young European founder.

然后转到美国，或者更喜欢如何成为一名年轻的欧洲创始人。

> So.

所以

有一种观念认为人们很难建立。

作为欧洲的创始人。

`[00:12:38]` 幸运的是，我认为欧洲还没有充分掌握技术的潜力和今天创业的方式。

但为了涵盖所有随之而来的事情，我们需要雇佣更多的人，我们没有钱，我们没有任何的市场营销知识，所以我们有这个伟大的产品，我们真的相信，但我们不知道如何得到消息。

这就是为什么我们申请了一个确定的年度竞争，这是欧洲最大的创业挑战之一。
