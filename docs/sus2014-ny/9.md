`[00:01:08]` 非常感谢 Y 组合器。

> I really am a big admirer of the program.

我真的很喜欢这个节目。

> Fund a lot of companies out of ricey and it\'s it\'s really the main reason I\'m here.

为许多富贵公司提供资金，这确实是我来这里的主要原因。

> One thing that\'s important for me to say before I start is I really never blog or tweet or say anything about what I do.

在我开始之前，有一件事对我来说很重要，那就是我从来没有写过博客，也从来没有发过微博，也从来没有说过我所做的事情。

> So why am I here.

那我为什么在这里。

> I\'m here really because I love Y Combinator 1 and 2 I love New York for startups.

我来这里真的是因为我爱 Y 组合 1 和 2，我喜欢纽约的初创公司。

> So you know when not when I was invited I thought okay this will be this will be fun.

所以你知道，当我被邀请的时候，我想好吧，这会很有趣的。

> There\'s a variety of reasons why I don\'t really talk about what I do.

我为什么不真正谈论我所做的事，原因有很多。

> But the main reason is I think really the companies are the most important thing about what I do.

但主要原因是我认为公司是我所做的最重要的事情。

> So it\'s really not important for me to talk it\'s really more important for them to talk.

所以这对我来说并不重要，对他们来说更重要。

> So when I was invited here I really to think like I do I really want to do this.

所以当我被邀请来这里的时候，我真的像我想的那样，我真的很想这样做。

> And you know one of the main.

你知道其中一个主要的。

> And what do I want to say.

我想说什么。

> `[00:01:58]` And the main reason I decided to come is because the reason I don\'t blog or tweet or talk about what I do is that I often am told I give the opposite advice of what people normally hear.

`[00:01:58]` 我决定来的主要原因是，我不写博客、推特或谈论我所做的事情，是因为我经常被告知我给出了与人们通常听到的相反的建议。

> So I thought that\'s a great way to use this time.

所以我觉得这是个很好的利用时间的方法。

> I\'m going to just go through the major areas that I hear over and over and over again that I\'m giving people the opposite advice of what they normally hear.

我只想一遍又一遍地重复我听到的主要领域，我给人们的建议与他们通常听到的相反。

> And I thought that would be the best way to use this time.

我认为这是利用这段时间的最佳方式。

> So first of all I made this presentation with a lot of help but one of one of the things is it\'s in this beautiful format of paper which I think is an amazing presentation format.

所以，首先，我在很多帮助下做了这个报告，但其中一件事是，它是用这种漂亮的纸张格式写成的，我认为这是一种很棒的演示格式。

> So if you\'re wondering what this is it\'s it\'s one of my companies that I love very much.

所以，如果你想知道这是什么，那是我非常喜欢的公司之一。

> 53 is paper.

53 是纸。

> So.

所以

> The first thing I\'ll cover is runway.

我要掩护的第一件事就是跑道。

> I\'m just going to like hit a couple of major topics and talk about my thoughts on each one.

我只想谈几个主要的话题，然后谈谈我对每一个话题的想法。

> So one of the first things I see when companies come to raise money is that they\'re raising money for runway so they\'ll often say I\'m raising a million and half dollars that\'s for 18 months.

所以，当公司开始筹集资金时，我看到的第一件事是，他们正在为跑道筹集资金，所以他们经常会说，我正在募集 150 万美元，为期 18 个月。

> And and that\'s and that\'s what we\'re doing right there.

这就是我们现在要做的。

> I don\'t like that.

我不喜欢这样。

> So I like when when people are raising money to get their company done by any means necessary.

因此，我喜欢当人们筹集资金使他们的公司以任何必要的方式完成。

> It\'s not about having 18 months.

不是为了有 18 个月。

> It\'s about making whatever you raised last and whatever you\'re able to raise last whether you\'re raising a lot or whether you\'re raising a little.

它是关于让你最后养的东西和你能最后养的东西，不管你是养了很多还是养了一点。

> And actually one of the things that I think is really great about Y Combinator and I\'ve I\'ve known Weiss\'s since it was a Boston program and if you meet companies from Weiss\'s and you talk to them even the ones that are in the Boston program 16 seven years ago what you realize is that they don\'t think about raising money as runway in the very early stage.

事实上，我认为 YCombinator 非常棒的一件事，我从波士顿项目开始就知道 Weiss，如果你遇到 Weiss 的公司，然后和他们交谈，甚至是七年前在波士顿项目中的那些公司，你就会意识到，在早期阶段，他们并没有考虑作为跑道来筹集资金。

> They think about it as How am I going to get this done by any means necessary and how long is it going to last.

他们认为我将如何以任何必要的方式完成这一任务，以及它将持续多长时间。

> And and and that\'s the most important thing.

这是最重要的。

> It\'s not about.

不是关于。

> It\'s not about having enough because runway really is about labor.

这并不是关于拥有足够的，因为跑道真的是关于劳动的。

> It\'s about payroll it\'s about rent.

这是关于工资的，是关于房租的。

> So what you often find in companies that aren\'t thinking about runway they think about how we\'re going to solve some of those problems in different ways.

所以，在那些不考虑跑道的公司里，你经常会发现，他们会思考我们将如何以不同的方式解决其中的一些问题。

> How am I going to get not to pay rent.

我怎么才能不付房租呢。

> So one of the things I try to do for my companies especially if they don\'t raise a lot of money is how to get them free space for as long as possible.

因此，我试图为我的公司做的事情之一，尤其是如果他们没有筹集到很多钱的话，就是如何给他们尽可能长的免费空间。

> That\'s one of the that\'s just one of the one of the ways to get the money ticking down another way is of course thinking about labor how many people do you really need.

这是其中之一，这只是让钱减少的方法之一，另一种方式当然是思考劳动力，你到底需要多少人？

> Who are you paying.

你付钱给谁。

> Why are you paying them how much you paying them.

你为什么要付给他们多少钱。

> And that\'s a big factor.

这是一个很大的因素。

> So I think runway is sort of one of those things.

所以我认为跑道就是其中之一。

> It\'s often the thing in the beginning that is is like the most important of how to get as far as you can because you know your valuation only goes up after that.

这通常是一开始最重要的事情，那就是如何走得尽可能远，因为你知道你的估值只是在那之后才会上升。

> And hopefully that\'s that\'s sort of my philosophy on runway founders cofounders.

希望这是我在跑道上的创始人共同创始人的哲学。

> Common knowledge I think is that it\'s it\'s good to have cofounders.

我认为，有共同创始人是件好事。

> For some people I think that\'s true.

对某些人来说，我认为那是真的。

> I have a lot of single founders in my portfolio I think I think I think it\'s not always right to have cofounders.

我的投资组合中有很多单身创始人，我认为有共同创始人并不总是对的。

> I think certain people certain people that can take a company really far actually are not are not actually equipped to have cofounders.

我认为某些能够带领一家公司走得很远的人实际上并不具备共同创始人的能力。

> They\'re actually better being a single founder.

他们实际上更好的是作为一个单一的创始人。

> And so I don\'t make exceptions to two that I like.

所以我对我喜欢的两个不例外。

> I like to see.

我喜欢看。

> I like to see people that can take the company the distance and having a single founder might sometimes be the best way to do that.

我喜欢看到能够与公司保持距离的人，而拥有一位单一的创始人有时可能是最好的方式。

> If you do have cofounders I think it\'s really important not to have repeat skills develop or designer obviously incredibly important product.

如果你有共同创始人，我认为没有重复的技能，开发或设计，显然是非常重要的产品，这是非常重要的。

> Sometimes that\'s inside a developer sometimes that\'s outside sometimes that\'s inside a design or sometimes that\'s outside.

有时在开发人员内部，有时在外部，有时在设计内部，有时在外部。

> I think it\'s really important when you\'re looking at who you\'re starting a company with.

我认为当你看到你和谁一起创办一家公司的时候，这是非常重要的。

> I can\'t I\'m not going to make a generalization.

我不能泛化。

> Sometimes people have known each other forever.

有时候人们会永远认识对方。

> They may have overlapping skills they may have known each other growing up and they may be the right person to start a company with.

他们可能有重叠的技能，他们可能认识对方长大，他们可能是建立一个公司的合适人选。

> But a lot of times what I\'m seeing are people that like just met the person couple weeks ago or months ago because they wanted to start a company.

但很多时候，我看到的是那些几周前或者几个月前就认识了这个人的人，因为他们想开一家公司。

> Now it\'s starting a company.

现在它正在成立一家公司。

> So is just something people do when they graduate.

人们毕业的时候也是这样。

> There\'s so many companies.

公司太多了。

> People feel like that\'s the only way to do it.

人们觉得这是唯一的办法。

> And I think that some people are just better to be single founders and you should structure the company around around your own skills.

我认为，有些人最好是单身创始人，你应该根据自己的技能来组建公司。

> `[00:06:47]` Time that\'s time to launch.

`[00:06:47]` 该发射了。

> That\'s what this means to me.

这对我来说意味着什么。

> `[00:06:55]` Common knowledge I think is you should get product out quick.

`[00:06:55]` 我认为大家都知道，你应该尽快把产品拿出来。

> You should iterate and it should be Leive.

你应该迭代，这应该是构想。

> Actually I often take the take the opposite view on this.

事实上，我经常持相反的观点。

> I think they\'re four years ago I might have said launch quick.

我想这是四年前的事了，我可能会说“快发射”。

> That\'s actually important today because there\'s thousands of startups and it\'s the thing that many many many people are doing.

这在今天是很重要的，因为有成千上万的初创公司，而且很多人都在做这件事。

> I actually think you should take as much time as possible to make your product perfect.

我认为你应该花尽可能多的时间使你的产品完美。

> And because there is so much competition you have to really think differently about what space you\'re in and how much time you\'re taking the launch it\'s actually possible today to have smaller groups of users doesn\'t have to be alive.

而且，由于竞争如此之大，你必须对自己所处的空间和使用的时间进行不同的思考，因此，在今天，拥有较小规模的用户并不一定非得活着。

> But I actually don\'t think it\'s good to rush products out.

但实际上我不认为把产品赶出去是件好事。

> I think if it takes you a year to make your product perfect then you should take a year.

我认为如果你花一年的时间使你的产品完美，那么你应该花一年的时间。

> It\'s not about getting it out because I think you have to have the hooks in it and a couple of of of like Trappes that are going to be the reason why consumers love your product and it can take a while to craft that.

这并不是说要把它弄出来，因为我认为你必须把钩子和几个像 Trappes 这样的东西放在里面，这将是消费者喜欢你的产品的原因，而且要花一些时间才能制作出来。

> And it\'s not so important.

这并不重要。

> I think today to just get something out there a minimum viable product I think actually what it\'s important to do today is to try to figure out how you\'re going to raise above and level above all all of the competitors.

我认为，今天要想得到一些最起码可行的产品，我认为今天最重要的是努力弄清楚你将如何在所有竞争对手之上和水平上提高自己的水平。

> And and that\'s something that timeline\'s kind of goes back to runway are really important to think about.

而这正是时间线回到跑道上需要考虑的问题。

> `[00:08:23]` Initially location.

`[00:08:23]` 最初位置。

> `[00:08:28]` New York versus San Franciscovs.

`[00:08:28]` 纽约对旧金山的比赛。

> everywhere else.

其他地方。

> I really like.

我真的很喜欢。

> I love New York.

我爱死纽约了

> I love New York to create companies I think New York is a very creative city.

我喜欢纽约创建公司，我认为纽约是一个非常有创意的城市。

> I think it gives gives people a lot of inspiration.

我觉得它给了人们很多灵感。

> There certainly a lot of a lot of input.

当然有很多投入。

> You get your product that you don\'t get in a community where everybody is doing tech.

你得到的产品不是每个人都在做科技的社区里得到的。

> There\'s a lot of money in the early stage in New York.

纽约早期有很多钱。

> So I think that\'s excellent.

所以我觉得这很棒。

> What there isn\'t is a lot of money in the middle stage.

中间阶段没有很多钱。

> It\'s still California I think primarily that has a huge advantage with the trajectory companies are able to get and doing things like Y Combinator.

我认为主要的优势仍然是加州，因为公司能够获得和做 Y 组合器这样的东西具有巨大的优势。

> Actually if you\'re going to be located in New York is extremely strategic.

事实上，如果你要在纽约办公的话，那是非常有战略意义的。

> You might not even think about the relationships that you\'re forming there how valuable they are going to be two years from now you\'re just thinking about how do I get my thing funded how do I get my startup like to be separated from everybody else which I see is excellent.

你甚至可能没有想过你在那里形成的关系-从现在起两年后，它们的价值有多大-你只是在想我该如何获得资金，如何让我的创业公司与其他人分离，这一点我认为是很棒的。

> But what it\'s also good at is really putting down roots in California.

但它还擅长的是在加利福尼亚扎根。

> So if you\'re gonna be in New York you have to have some roots there if you\'re ever going to if you\'re gonna want to go back there and having investors in both cities I think is also really important because you get very different perspectives and that\'s why I think location has to be thought about very strategically.

所以，如果你要去纽约，你必须要在纽约扎根，如果你想回到纽约，让投资者到这两个城市投资，我认为这也很重要，因为你有非常不同的观点，这就是为什么我认为必须非常战略性地考虑地理位置。

> Certain companies I think have real advantages to being a city in an urban environment like New York or other cities.

我认为，某些公司在纽约或其他城市这样的城市环境中拥有真正的优势。

> Others have real advantages with the amount of people you can hire and the talent that you find in California.

其他人有真正的优势，因为你可以雇佣大量的人和你在加州找到的人才。

> So Northern California.

所以北加州。

> So I think that\'s my view on location and I sometimes hear I sometimes hear the opposite or not an honest evaluation of what are really the pros and cons so this is like my favorite one.

所以我认为这是我对地点的看法，我有时听到相反的或不诚实的评价什么是真正的利弊，所以这是我最喜欢的。

> Nobody knows anything.

没人知道什么。

> Especially when it comes to investors.

尤其是当涉及到投资者的时候。

> And I think about that all the time myself and I find I find actually it\'s very liberating.

我一直在想这件事，我发现这实际上是很解放的。

> It\'s very liberating because I know many of the great companies that I found when I found them absolutely nobody else was looking at them most people didn\'t like them.

这非常令人解放，因为我知道许多我发现的伟大公司，当我发现它们时，绝对没有其他人在看它们，大多数人都不喜欢它们。

> And it was very difficult to tell them what they were going to become was going to be as big as they had.

很难告诉他们会变成怎样的人。

> They did become.

他们确实变成了。

> And I think it\'s important for all of you starting companies to really remember when you\'re talking to investors it\'s very personal.

我认为，对于所有刚开始创业的人来说，重要的是要记住，当你和投资者交谈时，这是非常私人的事情。

> It\'s very subjective.

这很主观。

> So if you hear negative comments if you hear like this doesn\'t make any sense.

所以，如果你听到负面的评论，如果你听到这样的话，那就没有任何意义了。

> Nine times out of ten that might be true but one time it may be that you\'re what you\'re doing is so new that nobody can evaluate it.

十次中有九次可能是真的，但有一次，你所做的可能是新的，以至于没有人能对它进行评估。

> And that\'s when really great things happen.

那就是真正伟大的事情发生的时候。

> You also might be talking to an investor that have just just 10 investments and they\'re not even they\'re not even in the headspace to do yours.

你也可能在和一个只有 10 笔投资的投资者交谈，他们甚至不在你的头上。

> So I think it\'s really important to you know when you sit down with investors talk about what are the last couple deals you did.

所以我认为这对你来说很重要，当你坐下来和投资者讨论你最近做过的几笔交易时。

> Look if you get someone that hasn\'t done a deal in a while they\'re actually maybe more open minded to you.

听着，如果你遇到了一个有一段时间没做过交易的人，他们可能会对你更加开放。

> And I think you have to be more strategic about it you can\'t you can be more strategic about the people you\'re talking to not just closing your round you can close people that are really going to spend the time and actually have an open mind to what you\'re doing and give you good feedback.

我认为你必须在这件事上更具战略性-你不能对与你交谈的人更具战略性-而不仅仅是关闭你的圈子，你可以让那些真正要花时间、对你所做的事情持开放态度并给你好的反馈的人关门大吉。

> So it\'s really important when you\'re talking to investors to realize look they probably are not any better position to evaluate what you\'re doing in a weird way then then you know the next person sitting next to you.

因此，当你与投资者交谈时，这是非常重要的，当你意识到，看上去，他们可能没有任何更好的位置来评估你在以一种奇怪的方式做什么，这样你就知道下一个坐在你旁边的人了。

> There\'s a lot of patterns.

有很多种模式。

> People get stuck in patterns I don\'t actually believe in patterns.

人们被困在我并不真正相信的模式中。

> I think patterns actually can trap you so into wanting to see the same thing that worked before.

我认为模式实际上可以诱使你想要看到以前同样的事情。

> But you know the river the river is always flowing and the markets are very different.

但你知道，这条河总是流动的，市场是非常不同的。

> What work today is not going to be work.

今天的工作不是工作。

> You know it\'s not going be saying it worked for years ago.

你知道的\不会说它在几年前起作用了。

> So personally I try not to look for patterns and contradict myself a lot so I\'m talking about patterns but I\'m talking about my advice.

所以就我个人而言，我尽量不去寻找模式，并且经常自相矛盾，所以我说的是模式，但我说的是我的建议。

> But I think when you when you\'re starting out in really crafting your company just thinking about the role that investors play and who you\'re talking to and where are they coming from.

但我想，当你开始真正打造你的公司的时候，你只会想到投资者扮演的角色，你在和谁说话，他们从哪里来。

> Do some research when you sit down with them before you just launch into your presentation and you\'ll get a sense hey is this person even like a candidate or are they probably you know kind of like is there is their plate already full.

当你和他们一起坐下来，然后开始你的演讲时，你就会有一种感觉，嘿，这个人是不是像个候选人，或者，你知道吗，他们的盘子已经满了。

> A lot of investors can\'t even really know if they\'re a lead or a board member.

许多投资者甚至不知道他们是首席执行官还是董事会成员。

> You know if they\'re on more than 12 boards that\'s like a lot.

你知道，如果他们在超过 12 个董事会，这是一个很大的。

> So if you\'re talking to someone on 12 boards or someone who\'s new you\'re you\'re much more likely to get the results you want with someone who is very open minded to what to what you\'re building.

所以，如果你和 12 个董事会上的人或一个新来的人交谈，你就更有可能得到你想要的结果，而这个人对你正在建设的东西非常开放。

> `[00:13:01]` And these are some of the things to look for development.

`[00:13:01]` 这些都是需要寻求发展的东西。

> `[00:13:07]` I have a couple things on product development that I that I that I find myself going over a lot.

`[00:13:07]` 我在产品开发方面有几件事，我发现自己已经做了很多遍了。

> One actually I got this advice from from paper I was with the paper team this morning and I asked them like what you know how do you guys think about product development as a startup what are some of the things you did that you think are valuable and what are the things that you think that you think you wish you knew.

有一次，我从报纸上得到了这个建议，我今天早上和纸业团队一起问他们，你们知道，作为一家初创公司，你们是如何看待产品开发的，你们认为哪些事情是有价值的，哪些是你认为自己希望自己知道的。

> And one of one of the things that\'s really important and I really believe this goes back to the number of people on the team I think it\'s really important to build for today.

而其中一件非常重要的事情，我真的相信这可以追溯到团队中的人数，我认为这对于今天的球队来说是非常重要的。

> If you read development blogs and many people that have worked at bigger companies leave those companies with the same disciplines.

如果你读过开发博客和许多在大公司工作过的人，那么这些公司就会有相同的纪律。

> And a lot of those disciplines you might read about in development blogs like aren\'t you know you\'re gonna spend a lot of time on infrastructure but you\'re not going to spend a lot of time on the products you\'re trying to build for today and prioritizing what actually is building for today.

你可能在开发博客上读到了很多这样的学科，比如你不知道你会花很多时间在基础设施上，但你不会花很多时间在你今天想要构建的产品上，并把今天真正要构建的东西放在优先顺序上。

> Having a big vision because when you start a company you often have a big vision like this is what were going to do.

有一个远大的愿景，因为当你创办一家公司时，你通常会有这样一个远大的愿景，这就是你要做的事情。

> This is our business.

这是我们的事。

> This is an area we\'re trying to disrupt.

这是我们试图破坏的区域。

> But from a real product development standpoint what\'s today\'s problem you\'re actually going to solve.

但是从真正的产品开发的角度来看，你现在要解决的问题是什么。

> And I often advise companies that are also going to Y see go to see to grow because some of the connections and the relationships you\'re making have really been incredible difference makers for companies to either get other startups using their product or take advantage of the mentors there to teach them like really how to craft growth.

我经常建议那些也会去 Y 的公司去看看增长，因为你所建立的一些联系和关系真的让公司产生了难以置信的不同，公司要么利用他们的产品找到其他的初创公司，要么利用那里的导师来教他们如何真正地创造增长。

> When you have that solid product and I think that\'s one of the best things to remember about about building another thing I like to think about again time I think I think you want to take as much time as possible to build a perfect product.

当你有了坚实的产品，我认为这是建造另一件东西时最好记住的事情之一，我想再想一次，我想你想花尽可能多的时间来构建一个完美的产品。

> One thing that\'s related to this is design.

与此相关的一件事是设计。

> I think today design is really becoming like all the same great design is all the same there\'s the same CSSA templates.

我认为今天的设计真的变得像所有的一样，伟大的设计，都一样，有相同的综援模板。

> A lot of people are using.

很多人都在用。

> And so the line kind of bleed into each other you know kind of what makes great design today it\'s like flat it\'s whatever you know whatever sort of Apple is also bringing forward which is great but you don\'t have any breakthroughs.

因此，这条线互相渗透，你知道，今天是什么使设计伟大，它就像扁平的，无论你知道什么，苹果也提出了什么，这是很棒的，但你没有任何突破。

> So if everybody\'s using the same templates the same full bleed photos the same sans serif fonts the same saturated colors which are all beautiful and today we\'re train especially investors are trained to look at a design and be like oh that\'s clean that\'s beautiful that looks like it\'s supposed to look but it looks like everything else.

因此，如果每个人都使用相同的模板、相同的满是流血的照片、同样的无衬线字体、同样的饱和颜色，这些颜色都是美丽的。今天，我们接受了培训，特别是投资者们接受了培训，让他们看到一个设计，看起来很干净，漂亮，看起来像它应该看起来，但它看起来像其他东西。

> So what I actually like to look for and I\'ve funded a lot of stuff that did not look good because I knew like all you have to do is a good tip of the iceberg you should have to put some design onto that.

所以我真正喜欢找的是，我资助了很多看起来不太好的东西，因为我知道你要做的就是冰山一角，你应该把一些设计放在上面。

> But if you have something really breakthrough don\'t worry about how it looks because how it looks is often going to be something you can do use one of those as templates that everybody else is going to judge you by.

但是，如果你有真正的突破，不要担心它的外观，因为它的外观通常是这样的，你可以使用其中的一个模板，其他人都会用它来评判你。

> But I think if there\'s any designers in the room I think it\'s time to push past what everybody is starting to look like and that\'s something that I look for.

但我认为，如果房间里有任何设计师，我认为是时候抛开每个人都开始看起来的样子了，这就是我想要的东西。

> I know that you know we got to this design because there you know this kind of pervasive design because you know there was another pervasive design that kind of got overtaken by this one I think we\'re ready to have a new a new look.

我知道你知道我们有了这样的设计，因为你知道这种普遍的设计，因为你知道有另一个普适的设计，它被这个设计取代了，我想我们已经准备好有一个新的外观了。

> I don\'t know what it is of course that\'s what I look for everyday but I\'d really like to see products not be so skin deep because I think that you can get trapped in the skin deep ness of a product and not worry about what what are you really trying to do that\'s breakthrough underneath.

我不知道这是什么，当然，这是我每天寻找的，但我真的希望看到产品不是那么深，因为我认为，你可以被困在一个产品的皮肤深度，而不担心你真正想做的是什么，这一突破的背后。

> How hard is it.

有多难啊。

> How much time does it take to get perfect and often design is last.

要花多少时间才能获得完美，而设计往往是最后一次。

> `[00:16:48]` And I hope there are breakthroughs there but I really would focus on sort of the iceberg of the productvs.

`[00:16:48]` 我希望那里有突破，但我真的会把重点放在产品的冰山上。

> versus the surface people so related to runway know people raise money and they say we\'re going to go higher five people to hire seven people hire for developers because we need for developers to get this done by three months.

相对于与跑道相关的地面人员来说，他们知道人们会筹集资金，他们说我们会更高-5 个人为开发商雇佣 7 人-因为我们需要开发商在 3 个月前完成这项工作。

> And what I found is that most people that are starting startups don\'t know how to manage people and you know you\'re going to find yourself overwhelmed.

我发现，大多数刚开始创业的人都不知道如何管理人，而且你知道你会发现自己不知所措。

> And it\'s really important to affect how you manage people one by one.

影响你一个接一个地管理人的方式是非常重要的。

> So if you say have a single founder you should hire one person and perfected with that person.

因此，如果你说有一个创始人，你应该雇用一个人，并完善与该人。

> If you have two founders hire one person Perfecta how you\'re going to manage that person and build the team that way.

如果你有两个创始人，雇佣一个人-Perefta-你将如何管理这个人并以这种方式建立团队。

> I think another thing is this it sounds this is going to sound really cheesy I guess but diversity is really important.

我认为另一件事是，听起来这听起来很俗气，我想，但多样性是非常重要的。
