`[00:00:02]` 好的。

> So my name\'s Kevin Hale.

我叫凯文·黑尔。

> My name is Casser Eunice and we\'re partners at Y Combinator and what that means really briefly is that social or not and batch were out there trying to recruit and talk to as many founders as possible.

我的名字是 Casser Eunice，我们是 Y Combinator 的合伙人，这意味着，不管是否社交，Batch 都在努力招募尽可能多的创始人，并与他们交谈。

> In addition we read tons of applications work with the startups as they go through the batch and then help alumni afterwards.

此外，我们阅读了大量的应用程序，当它们通过批处理时，它们与创业公司一起工作，然后帮助校友。

> Most of what we do is do tons of office hours which is what we\'re gonna do here today.

我们所做的大部分是做大量的办公时间，这就是我们今天在这里要做的。

> `[00:00:29]` There are four different types of offer office hours that we do the kind of first one is group office hours.

`[00:00:29]` 有四种不同类型的办公时间，我们做的第一种是小组办公时间。

> We split the batch in a kind of subgroups and we meet two partners at a time with like five or six startups and those startups kind of describe it as a weekly meeting.

我们把分批分成几个子组，一次遇到两个合伙人，大约有五六家初创公司，这些初创公司把它描述为每周一次的会议。

> They describe kind of what\'s going on in their company.

他们描述了公司里发生的事情。

> Group officers are really good in terms of helping you as a founder understand as you go through see kind of what tempo your company is growing at and also see that the problems that you encounter as a startup are actually pretty similar across very different types of companies.

作为一名创始人，当你看到公司的发展速度时，团队管理人员会很好地帮助你理解，同时也会发现，你作为一家初创公司所遇到的问题，在不同类型的公司之间实际上是非常相似的。

> The second type of OFSAA that we do will try to emulate here are individual office hours that is kind of when you heard the term office are vast multi-year time.

第二种类型的 OFSAA，我们将在这里尝试模仿个别的办公时间，当你听说办公室这个术语是巨大的多年时间的时候。

> That\'s what we\'re talking about the third type of OFSAA is company office hours.

这就是我们所说的第三类 OFSAA 公司办公时间。

> We\'ll have folks like Apple or Android or whoever come in Rackspace to beU.S.

我们会有像苹果、安卓这样的人，或者是那些来到 Rackspace 去美国的人。

> will come over and they will talk to companies and that\'s right before Demo date kind of warmed them up and getting ready for fundraising and for Demo Day.

他们会过来和公司谈话，就在 Demo 日期之前，他们准备好了筹款和演示日。

> So with that being said there\'s some other things I think that\'s worth noting about OFSAA and how to do them effectively.

因此，话虽如此，我认为关于 OFSAA 还有一些其他的事情值得注意，以及如何有效地做到这一点。

> `[00:01:44]` Well the first thing is obviously what we\'re going to do here on stage is not normal office hours so we only have 10 minutes with each company.

`[00:01:44]` 显然，第一件事是，我们在舞台上要做的不是正常的办公时间，所以我们和每个公司只有 10 分钟的时间。

> Usually we don\'t do this with 50 100 people inside of the room.

通常情况下，我们不会在房间里有 50，100 人这样做。

> So 17 and then I think the other thing is we usually have a lot of contacts with the company.

然后我认为另一件事是我们通常和公司有很多联系。

> So we have read their applications.

所以我们已经阅读了他们的申请。

> We\'ve got them a couple of times.

我们抓到他们几次了。

> Usually we\'re diving deep on a problem.

通常情况下，我们会深入探讨一个问题。

> It\'s gonna be a lot more tactical using we won\'t get to do that here.

这将是更多的战术使用，我们不会在这里这样做。

> What we said that all these companies as afterwards we\'ll go and talk to them a lot more in-depth.

我们所说的，所有这些公司之后，我们将去与他们更深入的交谈。

> `[00:02:17]` We\'re going to try to avoid creating like a pitch and response scenario and much more along.

`[00:02:17]` 我们将尽量避免像音高和反应这样的场景，还有更长的时间。

> Q What are problems that you face and then trying to kind of dissect them and hopefully get some value out of them.

问：你面临的问题是什么，然后试图对它们进行剖析，并希望从中得到一些价值。

> `[00:02:28]` The other thing is we try to make everyone sort of understand really clearly is that in officers our job is not to tell you what to do.

`[00:02:28]` 另一件事是，我们试图让每个人都明白，在军官中，我们的工作不是告诉你该怎么做。

> A lot of people come to us and kind of ask us like what would you do in this stuff.

很多人来问我们，你会做些什么？

> And a lot of times we will tell you our opinion for sure but it\'s usually what I tell a lot of the startups that you\'re trying to figure out your own heuristic so that you ultimately sort of run the company you don\'t need to come back to us anymore.

很多时候，我们肯定会告诉你我们的观点，但我通常会告诉很多初创公司，你正在努力想出自己的启发，这样你最终就能管理好公司，你就不需要再回到我们这里来了。

> I think the thing we like to tell people is like you need to start earning your own equity.

我认为我们喜欢告诉人们的是，你需要开始赚取你自己的股权。

> Eventually over time there\'s two things that we like to do when we have office hours to make them as efficient as possible.

最后，随着时间的推移，当我们有办公时间的时候，我们喜欢做两件事，以使它们尽可能高效。

> The first one is we love companies that know their number right.

首先，我们喜欢知道自己号码正确的公司。

> You\'ll see a little bit of this today.

你今天会看到一点这个。

> We\'ll ask tons of questions like diving into the company to try to figure out really clearly.

我们会问很多问题，比如潜入公司，试图弄清楚。

> Okay.

好的。

> This is where you are and then start getting a sense of like this is where you need to be your metrics are kind of the heartbeat of your company.

这就是你所处的位置，然后开始有一种感觉，这就是你需要做的事情，你的衡量标准是你公司的心跳。

> `[00:03:17]` It\'s always I think off putting if you don\'t know very basic things because otherwise what are we talking about.

`[00:03:17]` 如果你不知道非常基本的事情，那我总是想推迟，因为否则我们在说什么。

> `[00:03:25]` And then the last thing is we always prefer that office officers you\'re coming to us with a specific problem in hand that you want to have solved.

`[00:03:25]` 最后一件事是，我们总是希望你带着你想要解决的具体问题来找我们。

> So if you come to us and you just want to sort of shoot the shit or just like catch up on the stuff like I\'m going to be really sort of because like that\'s a really inefficient use of time for us and for you.

所以，如果你来找我们，你只是想拍点屎，或者像我这样追上东西，因为这样对我们和你来说都是浪费时间的，效率很低的。

> Because ultimately you should be like probably working in your shop and working on whatever growth numbers or KPI that we want you to be focused on.

因为最终你应该像在你的商店里工作，做任何我们希望你关注的成长数字或 KPI。

> And then there\'s a clear sign that if you having multiple office hours with us that we\'re going to be worried if you\'re repeating yourself so if we talked about something and I talk to you again like a week later two weeks later seems like we\'re having the exact same story or say.

还有一个明确的迹象表明，如果你和我们一起有多个办公时间，如果你在重复你的话，我们会很担心，所以如果我们谈论一些事情，而我在两周后再和你交谈，似乎我们有着完全相同的故事或说法。

> Right.

右（边），正确的

> That is not a good sign for you.

这对你来说不是个好兆头。

> The companies that do the best are usually ones that like everything that we talked about they went and tried and the other coming back to me say look this is what worked or like hey Kevin like this is the stuff that totally didn\'t work.

做得最好的公司通常是喜欢我们所说的一切的公司，他们去尝试，而另一家回来对我说，看，这才是起作用的东西，或者说，凯文，像这样的东西，完全没有用。

> Here\'s the reason why.

这就是为什么。

> Then we tried something else.

然后我们尝试了其他的方法。

> `[00:04:15]` OK with that let\'s bring our first company on I think it\'s divide divide don\'t go Oh we had some slides.

`[00:04:15]` 好的，让我们把我们的第一家公司带来，我认为这是分歧，不要走，哦，我们有一些幻灯片。

> `[00:04:22]` Now obviously they were not that relevant.

`[00:04:22]` 现在很明显，他们并没有那么相关。

> All right.

好的

> `[00:04:30]` Yeah.

`[00:04:30]` 是的。

> Give him a round of applause guys a brave for coming up here.

给他一轮掌声，让他勇敢地来到这里。

> `[00:04:36]` Thank you.

`[00:04:40]` 我是艾琳·谢尔曼·威廉·韦伯，我知道这是一项开源的服务。

> So we help applications easily connect to a back and server we handle things such as user registration and management data storage and querying and okay so far are you guys live or are you in data watcher.

因此，我们帮助应用程序轻松地连接到后台和服务器，我们处理诸如用户注册和管理、数据存储和查询等事务。

我们刚刚在周一推出了一个私有的公开测试版，到目前为止，我们只需要在 6 岁的时候就能忍受它，所以我们只想把它推广到 Android 设备上。

`[00:05:12]` 因此，Web 应用程序或移动应用程序现在只有 Android，我们将很快开始在 IWK 上工作，我们希望用 JavaScript 和开放源码 PASS 来实现 Schimel 5。

从那里开始。

> Like how are you guys similar or different from DPAs.

比如你们和 DPA 有什么相似之处或不同之处。

> `[00:05:30]` Well the whole reason that we started developing is because we were using Parr\'s for a few different applications that we were working on but we kept in running into issues are things that we couldn\'t do with Parr\'s because you can only do what it allows you with its API.

`[00:05:30]` 我们开始开发的全部原因是因为我们在一些不同的应用程序中使用了 Parr，但是我们一直遇到一些问题，我们不能用 Parr 来解决问题，因为您只能使用它的 API 来做它允许您做的事情。

> `[00:05:42]` So what are some things that you can do that passcode.

`[00:05:42]` 那么，你能做些什么呢？密码。

因此，作为一个开发人员，他们使用它。

> We try to provide all the basic API that they would need but if they need to do anything extending or based off they give me something really specific.

我们试图提供他们所需要的所有基本 API，但是如果他们需要做任何扩展或基于的事情，他们会给我一些非常具体的东西。

> It\'s still like never ever say you have a user sends in data for whatever reason and you want to do events based off that or if you want to query like another Web site from your web server doesn\'t give you a really good way to do that.

它仍然像从来没有说过，你有一个用户发送数据，无论出于什么原因，你想要进行事件的基础上，或者如果你想像另一个网站从你的 Web 服务器查询\没有给你一个真正好的方式去做这件事。

> `[00:06:13]` One of the big things you do it or they don\'t give you a good way to do it.

`[00:06:13]` 你做的一件大事，或者他们没有给你一个好的方法。

> `[00:06:17]` They do give you a way to do it you know more about that one of JavaScript side.

`[00:06:17]` 他们确实给了你一种方法，你对 JavaScript 方面了解得更多。

> `[00:06:22]` So before maybe a year and a half ago they released cloud code which is basically you could create javascript functions that are you could customize and do things.

`[00:06:22]` 所以在一年半以前，他们发布了云代码，基本上你可以创建 javascript 函数，你可以定制和做一些事情。

> So every single time you hit one of those it counts as an API and an API hit and then you go from there and so it has to be I\'m trying to figure out is like you guys have users right now some people trying it out and using it.

所以每一次你点击其中的一个，它就算作一个 API 和一个 API，然后你从那里开始，所以我想弄清楚，就像你们现在有用户一样，一些人正在尝试并使用它。

> `[00:06:44]` Yes.

`[00:06:44]` 是的。

> `[00:06:45]` So we don\'t know exactly how many because it\'s open source and we just launched on Monday.

`[00:06:51]` 这就是我们不需要整天安装的东西

> We should probably discuss what kind of business do you see this becoming because there are other open source products that become larger businesses.

我们可能应该讨论一下，您认为这是一种什么样的业务，因为还有其他开源产品正在成为更大的业务。

> What do you see happening for you.

你认为你会发生什么。

这是艘飞船。

> We will help you figure out what to make it will be is pretty good.

我们会帮你弄清楚要做什么是很好的。

> `[00:07:36]` I mean like from our research we think that companies will pay for support like they want the option to be able to pick up the phone and oh are they paying for SAPOL right now.

`[00:07:36]` 我的意思是，从我们的研究来看，我们认为公司会支付支持，就像他们希望能够选择拿起电话一样，他们现在正在为 SAPOL 付费吗？

弗雷戈斯不是我们的。

> `[00:07:47]` Well we know that.

`[00:07:47]` 我们知道这一点。

> `[00:07:48]` I think because we looked up support hopefully on your site and it said like go to stack overflow like literally like go to stack overflow.

`[00:07:48]` 我想，因为我们希望在你的站点上找到支持，上面写着，就像堆栈溢出一样。

> `[00:07:57]` Yeah.

`[00:07:57]` 是的。

> So we do we do provide like free support because right now we\'re just trying to build the community.

所以我们确实提供了免费的支持，因为我们现在只是在努力建设社区。

我认为任何类似的事情，特别是当我们试图建立平台，让人们对你感到兴奋的时候，只需要让人们喜欢注册和成长。

> And you got to figure out how you\'re going to sort of detect that.

你得弄清楚你要怎么发现这个。

> But your biggest thing is like I would not put any barriers to that growth and I\'d be as open as also site will help anyone right now doing this especially since you guys the thing is in beta currently right now.

但你最大的事情是，我不会为这种增长设置任何障碍，而且我也会像网站一样开放，这将帮助任何人现在做这件事，特别是因为你们这些家伙，这个东西现在正处于测试阶段。

所以，作为一个人，我最不想看到的东西就是一个表面，我要在数据的基础上构建我的应用程序。

> Right.

我的意思是说，那肯定是一场彻头彻尾的赌博。

> `[00:09:08]` But that\'s scary because it fits so far down the line.

`[00:09:08]` 但那很可怕，因为它非常适合。

> `[00:09:11]` I mean that kind of general mechanics of a company or you need money to support your your company and then you need to extract value from whatever ecosystem or extract money from the ecosystem and that would require for you guys a large community who is dedicated to divide and then institutions or folks that are willing to pay me their small or large companies that are willing to pay.

`[00:09:11]` 我指的是一家公司的一般机制，或者你需要钱来支持你的公司，然后你需要从任何生态系统中提取价值，或者从生态系统中榨取资金，这将需要你们有一个致力于分裂的大社区，然后是那些愿意支付给我他们的小公司或大公司的机构或人。

> That\'s pretty scary because that could take a long time to get to every sort of any other alternative other than the RedHat Mungo.

这非常可怕，因为除了 RedHatMungo 之外，这可能需要很长时间才能找到任何其他的选择。

> `[00:09:40]` Well eventually we would like to do some type of hosted solution to directly compete with Pathom in the others but we want to make it to where it doesn\'t have the same limitations.

`[00:09:40]` 最后，我们想要做一些托管解决方案，以便在其他解决方案中直接与 Pathom 竞争，但我们希望将其应用到没有相同限制的地方。

`[00:09:52]` 所以我们已经很接近时间了。

> Yeah.

嗯

> So just going to end on here.

到此为止吧。

> Like your biggest thing is like you\'ve got to build a community no matter what and that\'s like the biggest evidence that I as an investor is going to look at for something like this.

就像你最重要的事情是，不管发生什么，你都必须建立一个社区，这就像我作为一个投资者要寻找这样的东西的最大证据。

> Right.

右（边），正确的

> Is like getting a sense for how many people are using it and are you talking terms of users that are trying it like.

就像了解了有多少人在使用它，而你在谈论的是那些尝试使用它的用户的术语。

是

`[00:10:17]` 据我们所知。

> Like I said we just launch on Monday just with one Reddit post I see.

就像我说的，我们周一刚刚发布了一个 Reddit 帖子，我看到了。

> So we have like we have 12.

所以我们就像我们有 12 人一样。

> So we have like 12 people who are part of the beta testing we ask for all their feedback.

因此，我们有 12 个人是测试的一部分，我们要求他们提供所有反馈。

> And so we\'ve already gotten feedback on our licensing we\'ve already changed that because we used GPS and we overlook that.

因此，我们已经得到了对我们的许可的反馈，我们已经改变了这一点，因为我们使用了 GPS，而忽略了这一点。

当您使用 GPL 库时，您应该打开所有的源代码。

我是说\就是这样。

这就是正确的态度，我的意思是，当你建立一个早期公司的时候，你有点像在这个黑暗的洞穴里，每个反馈-不管是结构化的，非结构化的，你可以从你那里得到的-就像你应该去的论坛里一样，而不仅仅是长时间运行它。

> So I think that\'s a great great start but it\'s certainly a reliable.

所以我认为这是一个很好的开始，但这肯定是一个可靠的开始。

> `[00:11:07]` Yeah so just getting as many people sign up as possible and like figure out like Who are the first 100 people that are going be super dedicated and have built like something cool with it because those are going to be the examples that inspires all the rest.

`[00:11:07]` 是的，所以只要让尽可能多的人注册，就像找出谁是第一批 100 人，他们将是超级奉献的人，他们建造的东西就像酷的东西，因为这些都将是激发其他人的榜样。

> `[00:11:17]` And I also I really would push on these support as a business model assumption by trying even at the beginning to offer some support and see if someone I mean it\'s it\'s certainly early but you should test that assumption.

`[00:11:17]` 我也会把这些支持作为商业模式的假设，甚至在一开始就试着提供一些支持，看看某人(我的意思是)肯定还早，但你应该检验一下这个假设。

> `[00:11:32]` All right guys thanks.

`[00:11:32]` 好的，伙计们，谢谢。

> `[00:11:33]` Klaus have already lost the clicker.

> `[00:12:34]` The difference is that we have all the information on the prices location of products inside a store and deals.

`[00:12:34]` 区别在于，我们掌握了商店内商品的价格、地点和交易的所有信息。

`[00:12:44]` 我试着想，所以我把我的东西列成一张清单，接下来你向我吐出来的是一堆商店，像你这样的商品的价格都是你预先选定的商店。

> `[00:12:54]` Where were you getting to know that the worst thing I see is I saw your story but I mean for example if you get into another store you\'ll automatically switch to the store you read through shopping list.

`[00:12:54]` 你是从哪里知道的，我看到的最糟糕的事情是我看到了你的故事，但我的意思是，如果你进了另一家商店，你就会自动转到你在购物清单上看到的那家商店。

`[00:13:21]` 所以我们依赖于零售商，就像我们和墨西哥的一些零售商达成了一些协议，因为他们在这个行业拥有权力，尽管他们想要的是他们自己喜欢的。

然后，我们开始做一些其他类型的事情，比如 Facebook 广告，测试哪种信息更有效，实际上我们花了一笔收购，比如，在 1 点到每名用户 4 美元之间。

`[00:15:48]` 我的一个问题是，你是否真的让任何人改变他们购买的产品，或者改变任何人的行为，因为这样的目标是正确的。

如果你有什么东西显示给人们看，员工的价格是给他们看的某种东西，这最终将是推荐，大幅削减数据播放。

是的，所以我们实际上是在从品牌中赚钱，因为就像我们最初试图从零售商那里得到的一样，他们的周期很长，而且他们有能力，但是品牌喜欢我们，因为我们允许他们在正确的时间找到合适的顾客，并利用他们的购买而不利用我们所去的商店的位置。

> `[00:16:36]` And so yeah that\'s what we\'re doing.

`[00:16:36]` 所以是的，这就是我们要做的。

> `[00:16:38]` I do want to go back to the data question only because it\'s so critical and this is growing so you are scraping stores.

`[00:16:38]` 我确实想回到数据问题上来，因为它是如此的关键，而且它正在增长，所以你正在刮商店。

> `[00:16:50]` No we don\'t have those stores.

`[00:16:50]` 不，我们没有那些商店。

是的，我们只有像在墨西哥，我们有沃尔玛在墨西哥，巴拉玛，所以你可以是零售商或其他商店只。

> `[00:16:58]` Yes it\'s not hype when you use the example of down the street there\'s a lot of retailers you\'re actually not in a lot of retailers are just in one.

`[00:16:58]` 是的，这不是炒作，当你用街尾的例子，有很多零售商，你实际上不是在，很多零售商只是一个。

> No `[00:17:05]` we\'re we\'re we\'re like five of the big stores throughout Monterrey Mexico City and we actually started with a small store because most of us wanted to buy we\'d found out that it\'s different.

不，我们就像整个蒙特雷墨西哥城的五家大商店，我们实际上是从一家小商店开始的，因为我们大多数人都想买东西-我们发现这是不一样的

`[00:17:19]` 所以\`[00:17:19]` 我们所有的商店都先去然后走-你发现用户很难记住你的应用程序存在，而且你有统计数据来激活 64 的内容。

> `[00:17:30]` Yes actually like for every like every happens two months that they haven\'t used it we sent an email to.

`[00:18:04]` 所以我们就像通过我们的个人网络一样，我们有消费产品的经验，我们在那里也有类似的联系，但实际上，当我们开始的时候，我们发送了一份有好处的时事通讯，一些明星向我们展示了它有多有效。

是的，如何扩展数据输入。

> `[00:20:04]` So we have like we have networks of as we said so we\'re going to continue topping them.

`[00:20:04]` 所以我们就像我们说的那样有网络，所以我们将继续超越他们。

> We actually have some new investors that are very good in that network.

`[00:20:19]` 我的意思是你们只是为了和他们交谈才能访问他们的 API。

> `[00:20:23]` Is that why now in order to go to connect us two trials.

`[00:20:23]` 这就是为什么现在为了连接我们两个试验。

> Right.

右（边），正确的

> And then after that in order to grow you have to be like a marketplace where the brands can do their campaigns without us like right now and we\'re doing it intentionally we\'re learning what is what their brands are.

在那之后，为了成长，你必须成为一个市场，在那里，品牌可以在没有我们的情况下做广告，就像现在一样，我们是有意的，我们正在学习他们的品牌是什么。

> `[00:20:42]` Yeah.

`[00:20:42]` 是的。

> Yeah I understand that.

是的，我明白。

> But the thing is like you don\'t build a market place to grow right where you got to do is like grow all the user\'s stuff and then you build the marketplace to make it more efficient.

但事情是，你没有建立一个市场的地方增长，你必须做的是像增长所有用户的东西，然后你建立市场，使它更有效率。

> Yeah right.

对。

> So like the only focus is like I don\'t get as many users as possible right now know it\'s because the brands will just come to like whoever has all the users.

所以，就像我唯一关注的那样，我现在没有尽可能多的用户知道这是因为无论谁拥有所有的用户，品牌都会喜欢上它。

> That\'s right.

那是正确的。

> So like you just figure out the supply side.

所以就像你刚刚解决了供应方面的问题一样。

> Yes.

是

> And then you can worry about demand.

然后你就可以担心需求了。

> Yeah like obviously there it seems like an it\'s insight which is good.

是的，很明显，这似乎是一种很好的洞察力。

> `[00:21:22]` Yeah for a while we have been paying like that but that is just amazing.

`[00:21:22]` 是的，我们已经付了很长一段时间了，但那真是太棒了。

> `[00:21:27]` Doesn\'t that form really doesn\'t make sense.

`[00:21:27]` 那种形式没有道理。

> Temme users for a dollar is because not all 10 users end up staying right here.

Temme 用户花一美元是因为不是所有的 10 个用户最终都呆在这里。

> Yeah.

嗯

> Yeah.

嗯

> It\'s like a third of that efficiency.

它大概是效率的三分之一。

> Yes.

是

> And that doesn\'t really scale in the long term because if you equate that to the amount of print dollars that we spent for those limited users is going to be throwing a lot of money out and you hope to get to the point where you don\'t have to advertise but there\'s nothing fundamentally in the product which would get you away from that interesting.

从长远来看，这并不是真正的规模，因为如果你把它等同于我们花在那些有限用户身上的印刷美元，你就会浪费大量的钱，你希望达到这样的程度，你不需要做广告，但是产品中没有任何东西能让你远离这种有趣的东西。“。

> So it is structurally setting up the product to continue to lose money which is that really doesn\'t apply here.

因此，在结构上，设置产品以继续亏损，这实际上不适用于这里。

> `[00:22:03]` But for instance like Target like water pricing is based on what they currently pay for in-store market.

`[00:22:03]` 但是，就像塔吉特一样，像水价一样，定价是基于他们目前为店内市场支付的价格。

> Yeah no we\'re not like so we\'re comparing to Internet like Internet standards of advertising where much higher like much cheaper.

是的，不，我们不像，所以我们和互联网相比，就像互联网一样，广告标准高得多，便宜多了。

> `[00:22:17]` I mean we\'re totally out of time.

`[00:22:17]` 我的意思是我们完全没时间了。

> Yeah.

嗯

> Yes it\'s great that you\'re going for brands and I think that\'s what makes sense.

是的，很高兴你选择了品牌，我认为这才是有意义的。

> `[00:22:22]` And I think the biggest thing is you\'ve got to figure out like what is this trigger that gets people to say like oh when I need to have a shopping list I got to figure out what\'s the best prices for stuff like how do I think of how to do that.

`[00:22:22]` 而我认为最重要的是，你必须弄清楚这个触发器是什么，它能让人们说，哦，当我需要一份购物清单时，我必须弄清楚什么是最优惠的东西，比如我该怎么做。

> How do you get by current users to tell other people about it.

你如何让当前的用户告诉其他人这件事。

> Sounds like the only thing that you should be focused on right now is paid acquisition is one of those things where it\'s like everything else already works.

听起来，你现在应该关注的唯一件事就是有偿收购-就像其他事情一样

> And when we add peedee acquisition to it it\'s like the gasoline Yeah it\'s great.

当我们把 Peedee 的收购加进去的时候，它就像汽油一样，是的，很棒。

> All this other stuff doesn\'t work then and you\'re throwing like water.

其他的东西都没用了，你扔得像水一样。

> And yes we do have organic growth.

是的，我们确实有机增长。

> Awesome.

太棒了。

> `[00:27:03]` The other thing is you know a good rule of thumb when you\'re building landing pages is anytime you\'re tempted to put up like clipart.

`[00:27:03]` 另一件事是，当你构建登陆页面时，你知道一个很好的经验法则，那就是当你被诱惑像悬崖一样放置的时候。

它可能不需要在那里。

> That\'s like the clipart almost never as providing any type of information which is valuable for those few milliseconds of scrolling down.

这就像剪贴画一样，几乎从来没有提供过任何类型的信息，这对于那几毫秒的滚动是有价值的。

> So I don\'t know.

所以我不知道。

> Two blue silhouettes shaking hands I don\'t know what that\'s telling me.

两个蓝色的剪影握着手，我不知道那是什么意思。

这是我第一次了解你们到底做了什么-这些都是实际的用例。

它并没有说明到底是谁的案件出现在标题中。

所以，你知道，这是一个更多的处理，我们不打算复制细节在这里。

> Some of the copy could actually use work like the maybe the headers shouldn\'t be distributed solar energy tools and you fishermen literally the customers that are actually using the product because then I can quickly and I\'m one of those people I\'m an SUV.

有些拷贝实际上可以使用像这样的工作，也许头不应该被分发太阳能工具，而你渔民们实际上是使用该产品的客户，因为这样我就可以快速地，我是其中一个人，我是一辆 SUV。

`[00:27:58]` 你是一个试图构建的开发者。

> `[00:28:01]` You know I\'m a utility company\'s project manager.

你知道我是一家公用事业公司的项目经理。

我能看到这个。

> So you\'re actually putting the people who are actually part of the use cases as as you\'re going to get that transfer information that much faster.

因此，您实际上是将那些实际上是用例一部分的人放在一起，因为您将更快地获得该传输信息。

> Finally getting to the further down this is probably the most confusing part of the page.

最后，继续下去，这可能是页面中最令人困惑的部分。

> Only after reviewing this a couple of times that I realize that these are actually not comparisons with each other.

只是在回顾了几次之后，我才意识到这些实际上不是相互比较的。

> One is a fifty dollar a one time charge and the other is a five dollar monthly because I kept thinking there\'s like an order of magnitude difference in pricing so I must be missing something in these like this right.

一次收费是五十美元，另一次是每月五美元，因为我一直认为定价上有数量级的差别，所以我肯定漏掉了像这样的东西。

> And like what you say is you\'re telling the difference is like how you use it is how it\'s different.

就像你说的，你说的是不同之处，就像你如何使用它，它是如何不同的。

> Right.

右（边），正确的

> But what you really need to do is tell me why it would be appropriate for me.

但你真正需要做的是告诉我为什么这对我来说是合适的。

> Right.

右（边），正确的

> So it\'s like hey do you need to one time grab all the billing data from from one of your customers.

所以这就像你需要一次从你的客户那里获取所有的账单数据吗？

> Right.

右（边），正确的

> This is the one you need.

这是你需要的。

> Oh do you need to have continuous access to your customers data.

哦，您需要连续访问您的客户数据吗？

> This is the one you need.

这是你需要的。

> `[00:29:02]` So that should be the only thing that is sort of a punch line here is the way you display information especially in pricing dramatically impacts the way people relate to.

`[00:29:02]` 所以，这应该是唯一能让人发笑的地方，就是你展示信息的方式，尤其是在定价方面，会对人们的关系产生巨大的影响。

> `[00:29:12]` Is this for me.

`[00:29:12]` 这是给我的吗？

> Which one of these options that I pick.

> He\'s being smart.

他很聪明。

`[00:29:41]` 这是值得的，然而，如果你有一张地球仪的照片，而这正是你所在的地区，我们在这个广阔的市场上有这么少的报道。

> `[00:29:59]` So like this zoom in to California and then you\'re like oh sure these guys are really pretty big they\'re all in California.

`[00:29:59]` 就像这样，放大到加利福尼亚，然后你就会觉得，哦，这些家伙真的很大，他们都在加州。

`[00:30:41]` 哦。

> I knew the tiniest link there.

我知道那里最微小的联系。

> So I actually went back to your e-mail because I was like this is I have no idea maybe this is the whole product I\'m just looking at it and then you have this simple 12 step simple 12 step process through how to demo your product.

所以我回到你的电子邮件，因为我是这样，我不知道，也许这是整个产品，我只是看看它，然后你有一个简单的 12 步的过程，通过如何演示你的产品。

> So.

所以

> `[00:31:00]` The two points are like 12 steps of the law a lot.

`[00:31:00]` 这两点很像法律的 12 步。

> `[00:31:04]` The other point is all of this should be built into the product so you know very quickly add new is the goal or add services to the fourth item on there.

`[00:31:04]` 另一点是，所有这些都应该内置到产品中，所以您知道，快速添加新的是目标，或者向第四项添加服务。

> `[00:31:12]` So that is what our friends are just design wise.

`[00:31:12]` 这就是我们的朋友们所设计的智慧。

> Right.

右（边），正确的

> The thing that looks like a button that\'s the thing that actually activates the page I\'m on my services right and if I click on that it just refreshes the page.

这个东西看起来像一个按钮，它实际上激活了页面，我的服务是正确的，如果我点击这个按钮，它只会刷新页面。

> Yeah.

嗯

> And then add new of course.

然后添加新的当然。

> You know the two tiniest link on.

你知道两个最小的链接。

> Yes.

是

> This is like they my my my recommendation is you just start on add new.

你就直接跳进去吧。

> `[00:31:35]` So the way Kevin actually dealt with this he really thought those were tabs.

`[00:31:35]` 凯文处理这件事的方式，他真的认为这些都是标签。

> And so he\'s saying oh well wait this is like my SO really we were really pretty lost here.

所以他说，哦，等等，这就像我的，真的，我们真的迷路了。

> So anyways we actually click add new I just zoomed in on if you guys can see for the for the value this is probably how big it should be.

所以无论如何，我们实际上点击 Add，New，我只是放大了一下，如果你们能看到这个值，这可能是它应该有多大。

`[00:31:53]` 嗯，它是相当大的，做吧。

> Laughter.

笑声。

`[00:31:58]` 最后，我点击“添加新火”，点击这里的点击器有点滞后，我被派到这里来，这很好，因为它很清楚地告诉我，有几个步骤是我必须要做的。

> I click step in the dropped on actually click on demo as you told me in the e-mail.

我点击步骤的下降，实际上点击演示，正如你在电子邮件中告诉我的。

> `[00:32:16]` And what you guys might have not noticed when I clicked on demo a third step appeared underneath but it\'s below the page fold so I didn\'t know it until I\'d retry it.

`[00:32:16]` 当我点击演示时，你们可能没有注意到，第三步出现在下面，但它在页面折叠下面，所以我不知道，直到我重新尝试它。

> And so these are things that so the kind of general the takeaway here is what\'s happening in real life in front of you guys is we\'re like users who are using this who have no context about what the product is.

这些都是这样的东西，一般的，这里的外卖，在你们面前的现实生活中发生了什么，我们就像使用这个的用户，他们不知道产品是什么。

> A lot of times when founders design their products they\'re using terms and interactions which they\'ve already kind of they\'ve already cash in their mind and so they\'re like oh of course well you know clearly someone is going to be picking the utility you\'re going to be and the you know.

很多时候，当创始人设计他们的产品时，他们使用的是他们已经意识到的一些条款和互动，所以他们会想，哦，当然，你知道，很明显，有人会选择你将要成为的公用事业公司和你所知道的公司。

`[00:32:53]` 是的。

我没意识到这是个演示。

> This is what you could avoid as a developer and just nothing was explicit.

这是您作为开发人员可以避免的，只是没有什么是明确的。

> `[00:33:03]` And at this point you\'re probably thinking this is will we develop the API.

`[00:33:03]` 此时，您可能会认为这是我们将开发的 API。

> Where\'s the documentation and why documented because it wasn\'t on the home page.

文档在哪里，为什么要文档化，因为它不在主页上。

> `[00:33:10]` I feel like for every API company the biggest thing you need to understand as an API the interface is documentation right.

`[00:33:10]` 我觉得对于每一家 API 公司来说，最需要理解的是，作为一个 API，接口是文档对的。

> That\'s the thing you need to get people most excited about and it actually is when we went through docs.

这就是你需要让人们最兴奋的事情，事实上，这是我们读博士的时候。

> Those are great.

太棒了。

> `[00:33:23]` There are tons of examples and you show up on Nightline on your on your applause there\'s no link to the documentation from your line but it\'s totally intentional because it is a B2B it\'s the document.

`[00:33:23]` 有大量的例子，你出现在夜幕上，在你的掌声中，没有链接到你的线路上的文档，但是它完全是故意的，因为它是 B2B 的-它是文档。

> `[00:33:42]` But the thing is like Yeah there\'s no what you want to do is sell them upfront.

`[00:33:42]` 但事情是这样的

即使你表现出色，比如说你在付费或者其他应用程序中，也不能以此为借口不显示你网站上的应用屏幕截图，比如人们是如何购买这样的服务的。

> `[00:34:00]` And it\'s going to be someone at the bottom level of who\'s a developer who\'s like hey I need to solve a problem.

`[00:34:00]` ，我需要解决一个问题，在底层的某个开发人员中，我需要解决一个问题。

> Searches were like Whatever Pompey\'s and like your documentation is going to be rich with stuff that\'s going to easily be findable.

搜索就像庞培的任何东西一样，就像你的文档会有丰富的东西一样，这些东西是很容易找到的。

> But also you can search look at really quick you say OK.

这是一个例子，开发人员可以构建正确的，所以在右上角。

> `[00:34:32]` Every `[00:34:32]` page you can download a Jason format of this particular page and on the aged Hammell if you just change that the DOT Jason it\'ll be the Jason implementation of that page.

[00：34：32\]每页`[00:34:32]` 您可以下载此特定页面的 Jason 格式，如果您更改 DOT JasonIt 将是该页面的 Jason 实现，则可以在老化的 Hammell 上下载。

> `[00:34:42]` So not now brought in an example here a demo example What should I press I should hit activate correct.

`[00:34:42]` 所以现在不要引入一个示例，一个演示示例，我应该按什么，我应该按一下“激活正确”。

> Luckily that was the only button that I saw so I did hit it and then it brings in essentially fake data and it says 13 bills over 96 time intervals and then I really didn\'t know what to do here I clicked on PTF and actually saw oh there\'s a demo Bell and that\'s really what you want to get users to it too.

幸运的是，这是我唯一看到的按钮，所以我点击了它，然后它带来了本质上是假的数据，它说，13 账单在 96 个时间间隔，然后我真的不知道做什么，我点击了 PTF，实际上看到了哦，有一个演示钟，这也是你真正想让用户使用它。

> I think the key takeaway here is just in workflow.

我认为这里的关键是工作流程。

> You know it really took a long time to get cut to just to see that users will do one tenth of the effort that we did to try to understand it.

你知道，只有花很长的时间才能看到用户会花十分之一的努力去理解它。

> And yeah yeah exactly.

没错。

最后一件事是实际的文档做得很好。

> So or as well as I think like I would do everything you can\'t put that front and center and use that as your selling point.

所以，或者说，就像我想的那样，我会尽一切努力，你不能把它放在前面和中间，把它作为你的卖点。

`[00:35:32]` 我们没时间了。

> That\'s how we get.

我们就是这样得到的。

> `[00:35:38]` Coming up here.

`[00:35:38]` 来到这里。
