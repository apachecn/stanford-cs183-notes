> `[00:01:49]` What I have said before entrepreneurs are born to be entrepreneurs.

`[00:01:49]` 我之前所说的企业家生来就是企业家。

> `[00:01:57]` Then once you\'re an entrepreneur you\'re a serial entrepreneur or you\'re probably going to start companies for the rest of your life or if you\'re like Zucker Larry Page you know it might be the only company you start but you are an entrepreneur for life.

`[00:01:57]` 那么，一旦你成为了一名企业家，你就成了一个连续的企业家，或者你可能会在你的余生中创办公司，或者如果你像祖克·拉里·佩奇一样，你知道这可能是你唯一的创业公司，但你是一辈子的企业家。

> And I think most entrepreneurs do correctly self select.

我认为大多数企业家的选择是正确的。

> And I think that entrepreneurs are born have to be born with some of the basics.

我认为，企业家的诞生必须具备一些基本要素。

> So which treats have to be in Born which can be learned so that the basics I think would be you have to have a hell of a work ethic.

所以，哪些治疗必须是天生的，这是可以学到的，所以我认为最基本的是，你必须有一种极高的职业道德。

> You talked about it at your Stanford class.

你在斯坦福大学的课上谈过这件事。

> You have to be ambitious.

你得野心勃勃。

> You have to be aggressive and you have to be tough because starting a company is the hardest thing on earth to do.

你必须有进取心，而且你必须强硬，因为创办一家公司是地球上最难做的事情。

> And I don\'t think people realize that until they do it.

我认为人们在做这件事之前不会意识到这一点。

> Since I\'ve watched thousands of entrepreneurs do it I know how hard it is.

因为我看过成千上万的企业家这么做，所以我知道这有多难。

> Plus I started my own company Alto\'s computer in the 70s so I know from personal knowledge how hard it is and I started another company of companies as well.

另外，我在 70 年代创办了自己的 Alto 电脑公司，所以我从个人的知识中了解到这是多么困难，我还创办了另一家公司。

> And so you think the driven part has to be inborn for sure.

所以你认为驱动部分必须是与生俱来的。

> You can\'t you can\'t learn to be ambitious and be driven.

你不能-学会野心勃勃和有动力。

> Obviously you have to be curious you have to be intelligent.

显然，你必须好奇，你必须聪明。

> I think being a founder is like it.

我觉得做创办人就像这样。

> It\'s like a vocation but if you have those basic skills you know where you\'ve got where you\'re you\'re determined you\'re tough.

这就像一种职业，但如果你有这些基本技能，你就知道你在哪里，你已经下定决心，你是坚强的。

还有其他的事情，你必须学会雇用一个管理团队。

> You have to learn how to manage these things you\'re not born with these things you have to want success so badly that you learn how to manage you learn how to find a management team.

你必须学会如何管理这些事情-你不是与生俱来的-你必须如此渴望成功，以至于你学会了如何管理，学会了如何找到一个管理团队。

> You learn how to recruit people and then spread your vision and and motivate them to be just like you and be fanatical about your business.

你学会了如何招募人才，然后传播你的视野，激励他们和你一样，对你的事业保持狂热。

> So `[00:04:20]` how can they tell.

所以`[00:04:20]` 他们怎么知道。

> How can these people you know it would save them a lot of trouble if you can tell them now whether they\'re gonna succeed in starting a startup how can they tell if they\'re driven enough.

这些你知道的人，如果你现在就告诉他们创业是否会成功，怎么能帮他们省下很多麻烦呢？他们怎么知道他们是否有足够的动力。

> `[00:04:31]` Well well I mean are you willing to work 24/7.

`[00:04:31]` 好吧，我是说，你愿意 24 小时工作吗？

> The really great entrepreneurs are 24/7.

真正伟大的企业家是全天候的。

> The word moonlighting is not even in their vocabulary.

兼职这个词甚至不在他们的词汇表中。

> I mean if they\'re dating somebody or they\'re married they warn their spouse that they\'re not first in line that this company dream is first in line and that that you have this vocation.

我的意思是，如果他们在约会，或者他们结婚了，他们会警告他们的配偶，他们并不是第一人，他们的公司梦想是排在第一位的，而且你有这份职业。

> You know it\'s like being a priest or a nun that that your duty is to your company.

你知道，你对公司的责任就像当牧师或修女一样。

> Now it has to be that fanatical and if you look at all the successful entrepreneurs they are that committed about it.

现在，它必须是如此狂热，如果你看看所有成功的企业家，他们都致力于此。

> That is a hard commitment.

这是一个艰难的承诺。

> But once you\'re willing to make that commitment you know then you know that solves the work ethic check off if you have that commitment then then your passion is probably infectious.

但是，一旦你愿意做出你知道的承诺，你就会知道这解决了职业道德问题，如果你有这种承诺，那么你的激情可能就具有感染力。

> `[00:05:31]` It probably means you can in fact find other people and make them as excited about your idea as you do so you can use it so you have to be a good communicator you\'ve got to be able to excite other people or the management part you can use a trick of leading by example.

`[00:05:31]` 这可能意味着你可以找到其他人，让他们对你的想法感到兴奋，因为你可以利用它，这样你就必须成为一个很好的沟通者，你必须能够激发其他人的积极性，或者你可以使用以身作则的技巧。

> Yes right.

是的对。

> You don\'t have to use leadership techniques you just say I\'m going to go do this and everybody goes as it with you.

你不需要使用领导技巧，你只是说我要这么做，每个人都跟你一样。

> Correct.

对，是这样

> `[00:05:53]` But but for management and recruiting you do have to educate yourself.

`[00:05:53]` 但是为了管理和招聘，你必须教育自己。

> You have to get advice about that.

你得听听这方面的建议。

> `[00:06:00]` Now there\'s many many books and blogs about how to do that.

`[00:06:00]` 现在有很多关于如何做到这一点的书籍和博客。

> So if you have the desire you can you can DIY you can do it yourself because there is lots of resources out there for you to educate yourself on the skills that you have to acquire that you\'re not born with them.

所以，如果你有这样的愿望，你可以自己动手，因为有很多资源可以让你自己去学习那些你不是与生俱来的技能。

> `[00:06:19]` They don\'t have to worry about managing people yet though that\'s like a good problem to have.

`[00:06:19]` 他们还不需要担心管理人员，尽管这是一个很好的问题。

> `[00:06:25]` Yeah yeah.

`[00:06:25]` 是的。

> Freed\'s you\'ve gotten to a certain point you can afford to hire people that you then have to manage.

自由，你已经到了一定程度，你有能力雇佣你必须管理的人。

> Yeah.

嗯

> `[00:06:31]` The first thing you gotta do is your idea has to be infectious enough that you have to find a co-founder.

`[00:06:31]` 你要做的第一件事是，你的想法必须具有足够的感染力，以至于你必须找到一个联合创始人。

> Since most companies start with with at least two people and they usually start with two people who know each other yeah.

因为大多数公司一开始至少有两个人，所以他们通常从认识对方的两个人开始，是的。

> And so they\'re able to feed on each other\'s excitement and then go from there.

这样他们就能以彼此的兴奋为食，然后从那里出发。

> `[00:06:51]` So when you\'re when you\'re deciding who to invest in.

`[00:06:51]` 所以当你决定投资谁的时候。

> This is not just a way to get Ron\'s money it\'s also heuristic for figuring out what works because how many startups you invest in now since this is my 20th year of angel investing.

这不仅仅是获取罗恩资金的一种方式，它也是一种启发式的方法，可以找出什么是可行的，因为你现在投资了多少初创公司，因为这是我投资天使的第 20 年。

> `[00:07:07]` So anniversary just like it\'s the 10th Startup School and in the 20 years we\'ve invested over 750 companies but in investing in the 750 companies each of which has a founder\'s team we have talked to thousands of companies about potentially investing because for every company we invest in we look at 30.

`[00:07:07]` 周年纪念日就像第 10 次创业学校一样，在过去的 20 年里，我们已经投资了 750 多家公司，但在投资 750 家公司时，每个公司都有一个创始人团队，我们已经和成千上万家公司讨论了潜在投资的问题，因为我们投资的每一家公司都有 30 家。

> So what.

那又怎样。

> Well yeah 21000 company.

嗯，是的，21000 公司。

> That\'s that\'s why I age ages up to 13 people.

这就是为什么我年龄在 13 岁以下。

你知道你已经看过 21000 家公司了。

是

现在我没有全部看，因为 SCVNGR 现在 13 岁了。

我不再做任何尽职调查了。

所以他们有模式识别。

> `[00:08:31]` They\'re now solving all the problems I used to solve five years ago so everybody\'s escalating their role.

`[00:08:31]` 他们现在正在解决我五年前曾经解决过的所有问题，所以每个人的角色都在升级。

> And then you have Kevin Carter and tofor my son who are also becoming wise old men because they\'ve been around Espey Angel for five years.

还有凯文·卡特和我的儿子，他们也成为了聪明的老人，因为他们已经在 EspeyAngel 身边五年了。

> But but we are Reifel focused on generational planning.

但我们专注于代际规划。

> I believe this industry belongs to young people.

我相信这个行业属于年轻人。

> And so you know tofor and Kevin are getting close to 30 and we\'ve actually said when you\'re 30 you know you better make sure you have we have four or five people at Esmie Angel in their 20s because the people in their 20s are the good pickers.

所以你知道，托福和凯文都快到 30 岁了，我们说过，当你 30 岁的时候，你最好确保我们有四五个 20 多岁的埃斯米天使的人，因为他们 20 多岁的人都是不错的挑选者。

> And then as you get wiser and older you\'re more better advice givers to the founder.

然后，随着你变得越来越聪明和成熟，你就会给创始人更好的建议。

> `[00:09:23]` Interesting interesting.

`[00:09:23]` 有趣，有趣。

> So there\'s that\'s interesting that in the adventure business picking and giving advice are different skills that peek at different ages correct in our opinion absolutely.

有趣的是，在冒险活动中，挑选和提供建议是不同的技能，在我们看来，不同的年龄是正确的。

> `[00:09:35]` So I\'m an age of bigot and I keep telling our team mate make sure we hire and bring in really smart 20 year olds cause in in 30 years I hope they\'re Roncon way and they\'re being interviewed you know by Sam.

`[00:09:35]` 所以我是个偏执的人，我不停地告诉我们的队友，一定要在 30 年内雇佣和引进真正聪明的 20 岁年轻人，我希望他们是朗肯的方式，他们会接受山姆的采访，你知道的。

飞到洛杉矶去。

> That worked out.

结果成功了。

嗯

> `[00:10:20]` By the way if you want a list of the companies Ron has invested in it it would be shorter to give a list of the ones he hasn\'t invested in.

`[00:10:20]` 顺便说一句，如果你想要一份罗恩投资过的公司的名单，那么给出他没有投资过的公司的名单就更短了。

> `[00:10:27]` Just assume that if you\'ve heard of some big famous startup run as an investor and you\'ll you\'ll pretty much be right.

`[00:10:27]` 假设你听说过一家著名的大型创业公司，作为一名投资者，你很可能是对的。

> I just assume it.

我只是假设。

> So what about what should people do.

那么人们应该做什么呢。

> I was just talking about this what people should do in college if they wanted to start a startup later.

我只是在说，如果人们想以后创业，他们应该在大学里做些什么。

> What do you think people should do before starting a startup.

在创业之前，你认为人们应该做些什么？

> Do you have opinions about that.

你对此有什么看法吗。

> `[00:10:52]` Well I you know whether or not they\'re in college for me really doesn\'t matter because there are founders who didn\'t go to college at all.

`[00:10:52]` 嗯，你知道他们是否为我而上大学并不重要，因为有些创始人根本就没有上过大学。

> Are founders who went to some of college and dropped out and then there some that went all the way through college Larry and Serguei went all the way through college and dropped out of the JD program at Stanford.

他们都是创办人，他们上了一些大学，然后退学了，有些人一路走到大学，拉里和塞尔盖一路走到大学，然后退出了斯坦福大学的 JD 项目。

> `[00:11:17]` So I don\'t think it\'s about where you\'re at.

`[00:11:17]` 所以我不认为这是关于你在哪里的问题。

> I think it\'s about when when the idea comes in your mind that compelling idea that aha moment that says this is it.

我认为这是关于当这个想法出现在你脑海中的时候，那个令人信服的想法，啊，那一刻，它说的就是它。

> `[00:11:31]` This is a company and it\'s usually based around a personal experience where where you have that aha moment and you\'re so motivated by it and taken by it that if you\'re not in school or if you\'re in school it doesn\'t matter you stop what you\'re doing and go pursue that idea.

`[00:11:31]` 这是一家公司，它通常以个人经历为基础，在这种经历中，你拥有这样的时刻，你被它所激励，被它所占据，以至于如果你不在学校，或者你在学校，那么你停止你正在做的事情并去追求这个想法并不重要。

> `[00:11:52]` So what you want to do is you want to set yourself up so you have these aha moments these personal experiences correct you and you could almost be anywhere for that to happen.

`[00:11:52]` 所以你想要做的是设置好自己，这样你就有了这些啊哈时刻，这些个人经历对你来说是正确的，你几乎在任何地方都能做到这一点。

> `[00:12:02]` I mean for Chad Hurley and Steve Chen they were at a dinner party took a video and found out that there was no easy way to upload that video and just share it with the other guests with Zach.

`[00:12:02]` 我的意思是，对于查德·赫利和史蒂夫·陈来说，他们参加了一个晚宴，拍了一段视频，发现上传这段视频并不容易，只是和扎克分享。

> It was like I don\'t want to go through the physical hard copy Facebook at Harvard.

就好像我不想翻阅哈佛大学的硬拷贝 Facebook。

> Why can\'t that just be on my computer.

为什么不能只在我的电脑上。

> And then 10 years later why can\'t that be on my phone.

十年后为什么我的手机上就不能这样。

> Yeah.

嗯

> So you know Shawn Fanning his roommate wanted to share songs with other people in his dorm.

所以你知道他的室友肖恩·范宁想和宿舍里的其他人分享歌曲。

> So Shawn Fanning hacked together a music sharing app.

所以肖恩·范宁黑了一款音乐分享应用。

> `[00:12:42]` So it\'s it\'s based around a need and an idea in all that creates the huge companies in all the cases you mentioned the need was the founders own need.

`[00:12:42]` 所以它是建立在一个需求和一个想法的基础上，在所有的情况下创造了大公司，在你提到的所有情况下，需要是创建者自己的需求。

> Absolutely.

绝对一点儿没错

> `[00:12:54]` All the biggest companies are based on a founder who had a need hacked it together and then said hey wait a minute other people probably want this and then and then they start to grow on their own.

`[00:12:54]` 所有的大公司都是建立在一位创始人的基础上的，他需要把它合并起来，然后说，嘿，等等，其他人可能想要这样，然后他们就开始自己成长了。

> `[00:13:10]` Notice what you said.

`[00:13:10]` 注意你说的话。

> The realization that other people might want it comes afterwards correct.

意识到别人可能想要它，这是事后正确的。

> So it really it\'s not even supposed to be for other people in the beginning.

所以，在开始的时候，它甚至不应该是为其他人准备的。

> Yeah yeah a lot of it is serendipity.

是啊，很多都是巧合。

> `[00:13:22]` But once once the serendipity phase gets over then you need to start thinking about product market fit you know who is the customer for this.

`[00:13:22]` 但是一旦偶然的阶段过去了，你需要开始考虑产品市场的适合性，你知道谁是这方面的客户。

> It\'s all about users which is why why see is so successful is once you come up with the idea then why mantra is well how do you how do you how do you find users who also want this product.

这一切都是关于用户的，这就是为什么 See 是如此成功的原因是，一旦你想出了这个想法，那么为什么咒语是好的呢？你怎么找到同样想要这个产品的用户呢？

> `[00:13:47]` Because unless you create a market there is no need for the product.

`[00:13:47]` 因为除非你创造一个市场，否则就不需要这个产品。

> `[00:13:51]` When you look at startups and you\'re thinking of investing in them do you care a lot about the story about how they started working on the idea.

`[00:13:51]` 当你看到初创公司，你在考虑投资它们时，你会非常关心他们是如何开始研究这个想法的。

> `[00:13:59]` I absolutely do.

`[00:13:59]` 我绝对相信。

> I mean I think the more compelling and personal story is the more excited I get about the company early on even though I don\'t know you know whether or not it\'s going to be a huge huge company.

我的意思是，我认为更有说服力和私人故事是越让我兴奋的公司早期，即使我不知道你知道它是否会是一家大公司。

> But what I\'ve said it probably to a lot of people in this room one of the first questions I ask is what inspired you to start the company and it is an inspiration.

但我可能对在座的很多人说了这句话，我首先问的问题之一是，是什么激励了你创办这家公司，这是一种激励。

> `[00:14:27]` You know when it goes in your head you are inspired by it and then and then you are driven by it.

`[00:14:27]` 你知道，当它进入你的脑海时，你会受到它的鼓舞，然后你就会被它所驱使。

> `[00:14:37]` So do you also care a lot about the story about how the founding team.

`[00:14:37]` 那么，你也很关心创建团队的故事吗？

> Do you hear tension to that.

你听到那种紧张的声音了吗。

> `[00:14:44]` Yes.

`[00:14:44]` 是。

> Very very important to understand how you as I said before most companies have a couple of founders and it\'s very important to know how those two founders met how they interact with each other.

就像我之前说过的，非常重要的是要了解你是如何拥有两位创始人的，而且非常重要的是要知道这两位创始人是如何相遇的，他们是如何相互交流的。

> Remember when we first meet them it\'s usually two or three people and I\'m always watching how they interact.

记得当我们第一次见到他们的时候，通常是两三个人，我总是在观察他们是如何互动的。

> If one person starts answering the other person\'s question then interrupts them a lot you know ding ding ding.

如果一个人开始回答另一个人的问题，那就打断他们很多，你知道丁仃。

> The warning signal those two founders from aren\'t going to get along forever and they\'re probably right now fighting about who\'s going to be the CEO when in the early days it doesn\'t matter who the CEO is it matters if you can find users and you have a compelling product.

这两位创始人发出的警告信号是，他们不会永远相处下去，他们现在可能正在为谁会成为 CEO 而争吵，而在最初的日子里，谁是 CEO 并不重要，重要的是你能否找到用户，你是否拥有一款引人注目的产品。

> `[00:15:31]` So how can these people be they.

`[00:15:31]` 那么这些人怎么可能是他们呢？

> They\'re interested in starting startups.

他们对创业感兴趣。

> How how can they find potential co founders when they have someone they\'re thinking of starting a company with.

当他们有一个人想和他们一起创办一家公司的时候，他们怎么能找到潜在的联合创始人呢？

> Watch what sort of filter should they.

看看他们应该用什么样的过滤器。

> How should they apply.

它们应该如何应用。

> How can they tell if this person would make a good co-founder.

他们怎么知道这个人会不会成为一个好的联合创始人。

> `[00:15:47]` Well most cofounders you know when I think about this most cofounders are collaborating and end up coming up with the idea together.

`[00:15:47]` 好吧，大多数的联合创始人，当我想到这一点的时候，大多数的联合创始人都是合作的，最后一起想出了这个想法。

> `[00:16:01]` If you look at Facebook Pinterest Google there\'s there are two founders for all.

`[00:16:01]` 如果你看看 Facebook，Pinterest，Google，有两个创始人。

> Two or three there\'s two founders for all these companies and they actually come up with the idea together.

在所有这些公司中，有两三位创始人，他们实际上是一起想出了这个想法。

> Yes one of them is the one that says I feel the need.

是的，其中一个是说我觉得需要的人。

> But the co-founder ends up being a friend of theirs or a colleague who says Wow I agree with you and I want to work on that.

但这位联合创始人最终成为了他们的朋友或同事，他说：“哇，我同意你的观点，我想在这方面努力。”

> Wow.

哇

> I think that\'s goofy and I don\'t want any part of it.

我认为那是愚蠢的，我不想参与其中。

> But it\'s the co-founder is usually somebody who shares like 99 percent of the excitement and inspiration of the person who came up with the idea.

但共同创办人通常会分享出这个想法的人 99%的兴奋和灵感。

`[00:17:01]` 我的意思是，有一些单一的创始人公司，但很少。

> `[00:17:06]` Why.

`[00:17:06]` 为什么。

> Why do you think there are so few.

你觉得为什么这么少。
