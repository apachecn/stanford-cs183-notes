> No one would actually give me a loan from a bank or whatever to help grow their business.

实际上，没有人会向我提供银行贷款或其他任何东西来帮助发展他们的业务。

> `[00:01:55]` And so they technically bootstrapped for 30 years which sounds like hell in the venture capital world but that\'s what they did.

`[00:01:55]` 所以从技术上讲，他们干了 30 年，这在风险投资领域听起来像是地狱，但这就是他们所做的。

`[00:03:43]` 但令我震惊的是，我对我的打击有点不知所措。两天后，一位电影制片人在那天晚上见过我，花了 15 美元给联邦快递他的剧本，他在剧本中说今天对我来说太棒了。

我的理想主义在那一刻崩溃了，我做了任何年轻女孩所做的事情，当你真的很生气和心烦意乱的事情，你称为你的妈妈和我做了 30 分钟，我在电话中哭了，并谈到了这个世界是多么不公平，因为美国是多么不可能的国家。

> `[00:04:45]` It\'s only the land of possibility for the lucky few that are connected and my mom who\'s very busy running her business quietly and patiently waited.

我开始在网站上与一些电影制片人和戏剧制片人合作，试图帮助他们筹集资金，然后我开始失败和失败，其中最大的失败是我帮助了一位剧院制片人，那天晚上我遇到了一位制片人，试图为一部名为“维希事件”的话剧筹集资金，这是一部关于种族貌相的戏剧。

> Got actors to volunteer their time even Richard Dreyfus signed up.

甚至理查德·德雷弗斯都报名了。

> `[00:05:41]` I hustled to get investors there and the whole point of the night was to do a concert reading a one time showing of this play with a goal that those investors are so impressed by the whole night that they\'ll whip out their checkbooks and cut a check and fund the full production of the play and odd I\'d be on to a new career as a as an Off Broadway theater producer everything went perfect except that last little bit which was the investors turned to me and they said oh my god that was an amazing play.

`[00:05:41]` 我催促投资者到那里去，整晚的目的是做一场音乐会，看一遍这出戏，目标是那些投资者对整个晚上都印象深刻，他们会掏出支票，削减一张支票，为该剧的全部制作提供资金。奇怪的是，我会继续作为一名新的职业作为一名演员。作为一个非百老汇剧院的制片人，一切都很完美，除了最后一点投资者转向我，他们说，哦，天哪，这是一出很棒的戏。

> `[00:06:08]` The audience was uproar it was awesome and they turned and they said that was amazing.

`[00:06:08]` 观众们骚动起来，这太棒了，他们转过身来，说这太棒了。

`[00:06:22]` 事实上，就在那一刻，我意识到他们不想冒险的原因，因为我是个无名小卒，我在百老汇没有唱片记录。

> `[00:06:32]` And it was in that moment though that I realized that if my parents and this elderly filmmaker who had had a lifetime of experience taught me that finance was broken it was this experience that showed me how it was broken and how it was broken.

`[00:06:32]` 就在那一刻，我意识到，如果我的父母和这位有一辈子经验的老电影制片人告诉我，金融已经崩溃了，正是这种经历告诉了我，它是如何被打破的。

> `[00:06:46]` Was that the people who wanted this play to come to life the most which in this case were the actors and the audience.

`[00:06:46]` 这出戏最受欢迎的人是演员和观众。

`[00:07:28]` 所以这一切听起来都很好，很完美，但是八年后，我学到了很多东西。

一路走来，我失败了一吨，我想要做的是分享一些经验教训，因为你们即将开始这一阶段的旅程已经开始。

`[00:20:27]` 所以在早期，无畏对我们来说意味着什么，你知道，成为超级机会主义者，真正找到了我们的方向-这个“众筹”这个词根本不存在，所以我们不知道我们是不是在做什么。

> But the next thing we did and we actually just did this a year ago is we actually define the behaviors.

当我们开始招聘员工时，我们的水平更高，我们进行了技能面试，并推出了类似的内容，但我们总是进行文化面试，这是为了确保人们的价值观和行为与公司保持一致。

> And so we\'ve identified this.

所以我们确认了这个。

> And one thing I should say is while you want a diversity of people and backgrounds and experiences which is where I started what you don\'t wanted diversity of is your values and behaviors because that\'s the glue that keeps everybody together.

我应该说的是，当你想要不同的人、背景和经历的时候-我开始的时候-你不想要的是你的价值观和行为的多样性，因为这是把每个人团结在一起的粘合剂。

> And then what you do with this is when you\'ve clarified your values and any favors you actually operationalize it and you reinforce it through you screen everybody in your hiring process for it.

然后，当你澄清了你的价值观和任何帮助时，你就会把它付诸行动，并通过你在招聘过程中对每个人的筛选来强化它。

> I promise you this kind of sounds nuts and bolts.

我向你保证，这种声音听起来很具体。

> But is so critical because then you actually hire absolutely amazing people people that are not only off the charts with their skills but also off the charts with their alignment with with your mission you operationalize it how you get stuff done and how you reward and recognize.

但这是非常关键的，因为你实际上雇佣了非常棒的人，这些人不仅以他们的技能出类拔萃，而且还以他们与你的使命相一致的方式脱离了图表，你把它付诸实施，你如何完成任务，以及如何奖励和认可它。

> `[00:22:30]` So every quarter we have an all hands which here here\'s one.

> Twiggy\'s are of course for people that make us laugh but it stands for whops IGIS.

Twigi‘s 当然是给那些能让我们开怀大笑的人使用的，但它代表的是 WOPS IGIS。

> Aigis or something from the top down Aigis are given out by all of us.

自上而下的爱吉斯或什么东西都是由我们所有人给出的。

> `[00:22:52]` So I go on I give other people Aigis based on how I feel they\'ve embraced and embodied our values and it\'s very democratic in that way but it\'s also very real and it\'s very raw and it also reinforces the fact that culture is not a top down thing it\'s not something you can create only something you can influence as leaders and it takes the rest of the people in your team to continue to reinforce it as well.

`[00:22:52]` 所以我继续给别人 Aigis，是基于我觉得他们接受并体现了我们的价值观，这是非常民主的，但它也非常真实，它很原始，它也强化了这样一个事实：文化不是自上而下的东西，它不是你作为领导者所能产生的东西，它占据了其余的东西。你团队中的人也要继续加强它。

> But it has to start with you.

但必须从你开始。

> And then you can measure it.

然后你就可以测量它了。

> Nothing would be good.

没有什么是好的。

> You\'re not a good Silicon Valley tech startup if you\'re not measuring yourself.

你可能学到的东西。

> And then we also have rolled out OK here\'s which\'s productivity metrics How well are we actually getting the things that we want to get done.

然后，我们也推出了好的，这里的生产力指标，我们实际上有多好，我们想要完成的事情。

> Again a strong culture is a culture where people\'s values and behaviors that the company needs to win are the ones that people authentically embody every day.

再一次，一种强大的文化是一种文化，在这种文化中，人们需要赢得的价值观和行为是人们每天真正体现的价值观和行为。

> And when people are themselves embodying the values of behaviors that they hold naturally they are more productive they are more happy.

当人们自己体现他们自然拥有的行为的价值时，他们就越有效率，他们就越快乐。

> `[00:24:04]` And so you\'re your execution and the company\'s results should actually show that alright.

如果我回头看看我是如何从一个年轻女孩做起的，那不是像我说的那样，我想成为一名科技企业家。

我专注于一个真正困扰我的问题，我专注于这个问题，我意识到我想要解决一些问题，并且想要解决这个问题，创办一家公司将是最好的方法。

所以我实际上成为了一名企业家，因为我不得不这样做。

> And then I found technology is a solve because that was the best way to fix that.
