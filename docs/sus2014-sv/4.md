我知道当我们两年前在 Kickstarter 上推出时，你们中的许多人可能听说过我们。

> I\'m here to tell you a little bit about that but also take you four years back to 2008 when I started working on this originally.

我在这里告诉你一些关于这一点，但也花了四年前，2008 年，我开始研究这个问题。

> So this is this is me in a YouTube video that I posted in 2008 showing off the very first prototype for what would become pebble.

这是我在 YouTube 上发布的一段视频，我在 2008 年发布了这段视频，展示了第一个将成为鹅卵石的原型。

> I was an engineering student at the University of Waterloo.

我是滑铁卢大学的工科学生。

> I was studying abroad in Europe actually at Taegu Delfs studying industrial design in industrial design kind of unlike engineering.

我在欧洲留学，实际上是在大邱，学习工业设计，有点不像工程。

> Everyone is always sketching everyone\'s always drawing things.

每个人都在画素描，每个人都在画东西。

> And as an engineer I didn\'t have those same trying skills at the time so I started sketching things and the first thing that I sketched was a bicycle computer that would talk to your phone.

作为一名工程师，我当时并没有同样的尝试技能，所以我开始画一些东西，我画的第一件事是一台自行车电脑，它可以和你的手机对话。

> I had this weird problem.

我有个奇怪的问题。

> Everyone in Holland bikes practically every single minute of life.

荷兰的每个人几乎每一分钟都骑自行车。

> And I wasn\'t born with the gene that let me type on my phone while I was biking.

我并不是天生就有让我在骑自行车的时候在手机上打字的基因。

> And so I had this brand new phone in my pocket and I wanted to see what was happening when my phone was vibrating who was calling me who was texting me who was emailing me.

所以我口袋里有一部全新的手机，我想看看我的手机在震动时发生了什么，谁在打电话给我，谁在给我发短信，谁在给我发邮件。

> And while I technically could have just tried to pull my phone out of my pocket while biking probably would have ended up in the canal.

从技术上讲，我本可以试着把我的手机从口袋里掏出来，而骑自行车很可能最终会掉进运河。

> So I thought of this bike computer that would show you text messages.

所以我想到了这台自行车电脑，它可以给你发短信。

> I started prototyping it.

我开始制作原型。

> One of my friends came along and said hey you know that by computer that your building probably would be a little bit more useful as a watch since some people don\'t bike every single minute of their life.

我的一个朋友走过来对我说，嘿，你知道吗，通过电脑，你的大楼可能会更有用一些，因为有些人一生中的每一分钟都不骑自行车。

> So I took apart a cell phone that Nokia 33 10 which is like one of the most popular phones in the world ripped that apart combined it with an arduino and made this super early version.

所以我拆开了一部手机，诺基亚 3310，就像世界上最受欢迎的手机之一，把它和 Arduino 组合在一起，制作了这个超级早期版本。

> You can actually see where I cracked the screen off of the phone and made and made this first prototype myself.

你可以看到我打开手机屏幕的地方，我自己制作了第一个原型。

> It wasn\'t beautiful.

不是很漂亮。

> It certainly didn\'t work perfectly but it showed me at least that this was something that I could use on a daily basis.

这当然不是很完美，但它至少向我表明，这是我每天都可以使用的东西。

> I went back to the I went back to Waterloo to finish up my final year of engineering and did what I\'m sure a lot of you guys do which is pitch pitch your heart out.

我回到了滑铁卢，完成了我的最后一年的工程，我确信你们中的很多人都会这样做，那就是全力以赴。

这是我们早期甲板上的滑梯。

> The company of The Times called impulse which stood for information pulse and it aimed to do one thing which was show you text messages emails and calls right on your wrist.

“泰晤士报”的公司叫做“冲动”，它代表着信息的脉搏，它的目标是做一件事，就是在手腕上给你发短信、发邮件和打电话。

> I did these pitch competitions where you stand up and you talk for 45 seconds in like elevator pitch competitions.

我做了这些球场比赛，你站起来，你在 45 秒的时间里，就像电梯投球比赛一样。

> And that was actually how we funded the early stage of the company.

事实上，这就是我们为公司早期阶段提供资金的方式。

> I would win these gigantic checks comically large checks which are very difficult to cash at times.

我会赢得这些巨大的支票，滑稽的大支票，有时很难兑现。

> You have to like fold them up and the first the first prototypes that we built were actually funded from these pitched competitions.

你必须把它们折叠起来，我们建造的第一批原型实际上是由这些比赛资助的。

> I borrowed some money from my parents who were extremely generous at that time.

我向当时非常慷慨的父母借了一些钱。

我们建立了我和几个朋友建立了第一个实际工作的原型。

你注意到我的原型是第一个。

> This is the much better prototype that was actually built by some talented electrical engineers and computer computer engineers.

这是一个更好的原型，实际上是由一些有才华的电气工程师和计算机工程师建造的。

> Being in Waterloo as I\'m sure there\'s a couple Waterloo people in the crowd.

我敢肯定，在滑铁卢的人群中有几个滑铁卢人。

> `[00:03:42]` Being in Waterloo in 2008 meant one thing.

`[00:03:50]` 这是非常流行的手机键盘，所以你可以在这里看到，第一个原型实际上是与黑莓一起工作的，它不仅适用于黑莓。

`[00:04:00]` 它只适用于黑莓的笑声。

> So you can see there\'s still some wires coming out of it.

所以你可以看到仍然有一些电线从里面出来。

> `[00:04:06]` But generally it actually did the job this is a real text message that someone sent to my Blackberry at that time and it worked it it it didn\'t look great again but it finally worked and we could show it off and began talking about in the community people said hey this is a interesting little project but you know it could actually become a company if you wanted.

`[00:04:06]` 但总的来说，这是一条真正的短信，有人在那个时候发送给我的黑莓，它看起来不太好，但它终于成功了，我们可以展示它，并开始在社区讨论，人们说，嘿，这是一个有趣的小项目，但你知道，它实际上可以成为一个公司，如果你愿意的话。

> So I the first step was actually trying to make it look a little bit better than what a couple engineers hacked together in their spare time worked with an industrial designer who again remember this is 2008 2009 took took a lot of inspiration from the smartphones at the time to build what would be what would become our first watch impulse.

所以，我的第一步实际上是试图让它看起来比一对工程师在业余时间共同破解的东西要好一些，他和一位工业设计师一起工作，他又一次记得 2008 年的时候，智能手机给我们带来了很多灵感，这将成为我们的第一次手表冲动。

> This is pen and ink marker drawings kind of the first stage of ideation but you can see it\'s starting to look a little bit less like a circuit board with bent aluminum around it and more like an actual an actual watch.

这是笔和墨水的标志画的第一阶段的想法，但你可以看到它开始看起来有点不像一个弯曲的铝周围的电路板，更像一个实际的手表。

> `[00:05:04]` This is mid 2009 2010.

`[00:05:04]` 这是 2009 年年中的 2010 年。

这是一个 3D 打印原型，里面有实际的电子设备。

> This was the first stage that we actually were able to show it to people and they could immediately imagine what it would be like to put this product on their wrist.

这是我们能够展示给人们的第一个阶段，他们可以立即想象把这个产品放在他们的手腕上是什么感觉。

> `[00:05:22]` That was really important because up until that time we just had our circuit board that we were shopping around to people kind of hard for people to imagine wearing a circuit board on the wrist.

这真的很重要，因为在那之前，我们的电路板是我们买给人们的，人们很难想象在手腕上戴着电路板。

> 3D printing was still pretty early at that time 2009 Maker Bot had just launched.

3D 打印仍然是相当早期，在 2009 年制造商 Bot 刚刚推出。

> This was our first somewhat 3D printed a little bit hand painted as well but it did a little bit of a better job at showing off what what a smartwatch could be.

这是我们第一次有点 3D 打印一点手绘，但它做了一个更好的工作在展示什么是智能手表。

> So naturally the next step in 2000 is 2009 and of 2009 was to launch it just like every good software company in the world.

因此，2000 年的下一步自然是 2009 年，2009 年的时候，它就像世界上每一家优秀的软件公司一样推出。

> You know you have to launch early and often.

你知道你必须早早地启动。

> And I think we took that took that lesson to heart from a hardware perspective as well.

我认为我们也从硬件的角度把这个教训牢记在心。

> So in truth in the end of 2009 we decided to announce this product publicly to the world and I\'m sure many of you read and gadget in the version that kind of stuff.

所以，事实上，在 2009 年底，我们决定向世界公开发布这款产品，我相信你们中的很多人都会在这个版本中阅读和使用类似的东西。

> And you see these occasionally posts of people with posting leaked photographs or blurry photos of new products.

你可以看到，偶尔会有一些人贴出泄露的照片或新产品的模糊照片。

> `[00:06:25]` And the secret is is that sometimes those are actually devices that fall off the back of a truck at the factory.

`[00:06:25]` 秘密是，有时这些设备实际上是从工厂的卡车后面掉下来的。

所以这是一件非常好的事情，我们没有决定建造像 5000 件这样的东西，而我们只是建造了 10，20，50，100 套，然后发货。

`[00:11:33]` 所以这有点遥不可及，但我们觉得我们终于抓住了我们的第一款产品，人们开始使用的第一款产品，有 80%的使用者每天都在使用它，这不仅来自分析，而且人们实际上告诉我们他们已经发送了。美国的电子邮件，我在我的电子邮件收件箱，个人线程与几乎每一个人谁拥有这些第一次观察什么是好的，什么是坏的，什么需要改进。
