> And there was like not a single person outside.

外面没有一个人。

> I just said to myself like I want to be in a place where people want to enjoy life but work hard too.

我只是对自己说，我想呆在一个人们想要享受生活，但也要努力工作的地方。

> So Stanford was just like a natural.

所以斯坦福大学就像个天生的人。

> That\'s what drew me to being out here and being kind of a little schizophrenic and how I treat different ideas and go from thing to thing.

这就是吸引我来到这里的原因，我有点精神分裂症，我如何对待不同的想法，从一件事到另一件事。

> `[00:02:57]` But that\'s kind of the ethos of an entrepreneur hired at Stanford you kind of started your first thing I was a class classified my side.

`[00:02:57]` 但这是斯坦福大学雇佣的企业家的一种精神，你开始做你的第一件事，我是一个属于我这边的班级。

对不对。

`[00:03:06]` 是的。

你想做的就是给你的房间买个冰箱。

> `[00:03:19]` Right.

`[00:03:19]` 对。

> And I\'m pretty certain that every single year someone starts the startup and I caught this trap too which is just like how do you allow students to trade goods at the beginning and end of the year and there\'s this interesting mismatch between like the end of the year.

我非常肯定，每一年都有人开始创业，而我也陷入了这个陷阱，就像你如何允许学生在年初和年底进行商品交易，而在年底这两者之间存在着有趣的不匹配。

> People want to get rid of the stuff in the beginning of the year everyone wants to buy stuff.

人们想要在年初扔掉这些东西，每个人都想买东西。

> So I sat down and I decided to teach myself Ruby on Rails and I was like this is going to be a really awesome skill so I learned that learned about databases and learned enough to be dangerous.

于是我坐下来，决定自学 RubyonRails，我觉得这将是一项非常棒的技能，所以我学到了关于数据库的知识，并且学到了足够危险的东西。

> And this is like one of the lessons in entrepreneurship is that like you don\'t have to be the best but you have to be dangerous right.

这就像是创业的一个教训，就像你不需要成为最好的人，但你必须是危险的，对的。

> You have to learn just enough to be dangerous.

你必须学到足够多的东西才能变得危险。

> `[00:03:59]` To build an idea concept it and show it to the world and then it turns out there are lots of other people including all 170 employees that work at Instagram who are much better at doing all that stuff than I am.

`[00:03:59]` 为了建立一个观念，把它展示给世界，结果发现还有很多人，包括所有在 Instagram 工作的 170 名员工，他们比我更擅长做这些事情。

> `[00:04:10]` But you\'d need to find people who can you know be drawn to the idea that you build and and then they end up taking it and and make any of it better.

`[00:04:10]` 但是你需要找到那些你知道的人，他们会被你的想法所吸引，然后他们就会把它拿走，让它变得更好。

> `[00:04:18]` So I worked on a classified ad startup at Stanford called the trellised.

`[00:04:18]` 所以我在斯坦福大学做了一家分类广告初创公司，名叫 Trellised。

> It was supposed to be like Craigslist but the tree is the same.

它应该像 Craigslist，但树是一样的。

`[00:04:27]` 这是个非常糟糕的名字。

> I\'m not a morning out of the way.

我可不是一个早晨。

> Thank you everyone for laughing.

谢谢大家的笑。

> Laughter.

笑声。

> `[00:04:33]` So what\'s interesting though is I started it not at Stanford but actually while I was studying abroad in Florence.

`[00:04:33]` 有趣的是，我不是在斯坦福大学开始的，而是在佛罗伦萨留学的时候开始的。

> So I love art history I love photography obviously so I\'d studied in Florence for three months and I remember we didn\'t have much to do after class because it was the winter it was cold.

所以我喜欢艺术史，我显然喜欢摄影，所以我在佛罗伦萨学习了三个月，我记得下课后我们没什么事可做，因为那时是冬天，天气很冷。

> I think the program had 12 students in it.

我想这个项目有 12 个学生。

> So you\'d go home to your host family and you\'d eat an awesome Italian dinner and then you\'d sit there without TV and you just say OK what do I want to do.

所以你回家去找你的主人家，吃一顿很棒的意大利晚餐，然后你坐在那里不看电视，你就说，好吧，我想做什么。

> `[00:05:05]` So Wi-Fi really wasn\'t a thing in their building and I would have my laptop and I would literally just build this site at the time on my little.

`[00:05:05]` 所以 Wi-Fi 真的不是他们大楼里的东西，我会有我的笔记本电脑，我会在那个时候把这个网站建在我的小电脑上。

> `[00:05:14]` It was an eyeball look and what I would do is actually to ship code.

`[00:05:14]` 这是一种眼珠子的表情，我要做的实际上是发送代码。

> I would go outside of the apartment building down the street.

我会到街对面的公寓楼外面去。

> And like I remember specifically one day it was snowing it doesn\'t snow in Florence very often.

就像我特别记得的那样，有一天正在下雪，佛罗伦萨不常下雪。

> That\'s why I remember it it was snowing and I would go next to the public library line with my laptop until I got enough signal and I would like SYNC FPP to make the files go to the server and then I would send off all my emails promoting it to people back at Stanford.

这就是为什么我记得当时下着雪，我会带着笔记本电脑去公共图书馆，直到我收到足够多的信号，我想让 FPP 同步文件到服务器，然后我会把我所有的电子邮件发送给斯坦福大学的人。

> So I was literally just trying to launch this thing from afar.

所以我真的只是想从远处发射这个东西。

> `[00:05:45]` There\'s so much you can learn from even launching the thing that you know a lot of people attempt but the actual action of getting it out there like that was probably the first first step to a lot of the other things that you did later.

`[00:05:45]` 你可以从你知道的事情中学到很多东西，很多人都尝试过，但是像这样把它拿出来的实际行动可能是你后来做的许多其他事情的第一步。

> `[00:05:59]` Yeah I think what probably helped to you is like the idea that I wasn\'t on the ground listening to whether or not people liked it gave me enough like ammunition and confidence to like keep working on it.

`[00:05:59]` 是的，我想可能对你有帮助的是，我没有在地面上听别人是否喜欢它，这给了我足够的弹药和信心，让我喜欢继续努力。

> And then all I had it was like are people using this or not.

然后我所拥有的就是人们使用或不使用这个。

> Not like what do they think about it and are they judging the idea but like are they using it.

不像他们是怎么想的，他们是如何判断这个想法的，而是他们是否在使用它。

> And that\'s really important because what people tell you and how people act are very very different sometimes.

这是非常重要的，因为人们告诉你的事情和人们的行为有时是非常不同的。

> So the lesson I learned was not very many people were using it.

所以我学到的教训是，没有多少人使用它。

> So we ended up like I ended up forming the idea more and to a like less of a overall Craigslist and more of it just a goods transfer.

所以我们最终就像我最终形成了更多的想法，更像是一个整体的 Craigslist，更多的只是一个货物转移。

> `[00:06:38]` But again the other lesson here is sometimes it\'s not about the idea that you\'re working on but instead the skills that you\'re learning while you work on it and that really helped me not only learn to program but also like learned to market a consumer site to people.

`[00:06:38]` 但是，这里的另一个教训是，有时不是你正在工作的想法，而是你在努力学习的技能，这不仅帮助我学会编程，而且还帮助我学会向人们推销一个消费网站。

> And I mean colleges are probably the best form of marketing because everyone\'s interconnected and they talk all the time.

我的意思是，大学可能是最好的营销形式，因为每个人都是相互关联的，他们总是在谈论。

> `[00:07:01]` An incredible amount of groundwork for Instagram started far earlier and your experiences with previous start ups and learning to code.

`[00:07:01]` Instagram 的基础工作起步早得令人难以置信，你以前的创业经历和学习编码的经历也早得令人难以置信。

> I totally agree.

我完全同意。

> Just being able to talk to your other founders be able to build something for other people.

只要能和你的其他创始人交谈，就能为其他人创造一些东西。

> It all starts early.

一切都开始得很早。

> So from there I guess a lot of the people in this room are in college or are about to graduate.

因此，我想这个房间里的很多人都在上大学，或者即将毕业。

> Trying to figure out what their next move is.

想弄清楚他们下一步的行动是什么。

> And so you know talk us through what your mind where your mind was that when you were graduating what you were thinking kind of you know the first experiences right before during college and after college.

所以你知道，告诉我们你的想法是什么，你的思想是什么，当你毕业的时候，你的想法，你知道第一次经历，就在大学之前和大学毕业后。

> `[00:07:38]` Yeah I think everyone\'s experience is different.

`[00:07:38]` 是的，我认为每个人的经历都不一样。

> First every.

首先是每一个。

> Everyone in this room has to take the idea that there is a perfect next move and throw it out the window.

这个房间里的每个人都必须接受下一个完美动作的想法，然后把它扔出窗外。

> There aren\'t many windows in this room but throw it out the window.

这个房间没有多少窗户，但把它扔到窗外去。

> Okay.

好的。

> There\'s no perfect next move.

没有完美的下一步行动。

> I had the privilege of going to a Marine base once and talking to Marines about how they plan their next move.

我有幸去过海军陆战队基地一次，并与海军陆战队讨论了他们下一步的计划。

> And there\'s this phrase called bias towards action that I really was taken to.

有一句话叫做“对行动的偏见”，这是我真正被接受的。

> So the idea that you can spend all of your time thinking about what the perfect next move is trying to plan.

所以，你可以把所有的时间都花在想下一步该做什么的想法上。

> Am I going to work at Google.

我要去谷歌工作吗。

> Am I going to work at Microsoft.

我要去微软工作吗？

> Like which one.

比如哪一个。

> Like am I going to work at McKinsey or Bain like trying to figure out all like the next perfect move and spending a tremendous amount of time trying to figure that out.

就像我要在麦肯锡或者贝恩工作，就像我想找出下一个完美的行动，花大量的时间来解决这个问题。

> The Marines say you can spend all the time you want but by the time you\'ve figured it out you\'re dead.

海军陆战队说你可以随心所欲地花时间，但当你想明白的时候，你就死定了。

> Okay.

好的。

> So like sometimes you need to make a tradeoff of what is the action I can take with the appropriate amount of information and risk to move because moving and progress is what gets us to the next step.

因此，就像有时你需要做一个权衡，我可以采取的行动，与适当数量的信息和风险，以采取行动，因为移动和进步是什么使我们进入下一步。

> So for me I mean when I was in school trying to figure out what to do after college.

所以对我来说，我的意思是，当我在学校的时候，我想知道大学毕业后该做什么。

> All of my friends were interviewing at investment banks and Bain and McKinsey and they were getting these offer letters with six figures and I was like oh I got six figures right out of college is crazy.

我所有的朋友都在投资银行、贝恩和麦肯锡面试，他们收到了这些写着六位数的邀请信，我觉得，噢，我刚从大学毕业就拿到了六位数，真是疯了。

> By the way it is.

顺便说一下。

> `[00:09:07]` And laughter it is right.

`[00:09:07]` 笑声是对的。

> I like for a guy that didn\'t take a startup for the sorry salary for the first two years of you know funning bourbon Sosh Instagram.

我喜欢一个在最初两年没有接受创业公司的人，你知道，在 Instagram 上玩波旁威士忌 Instagram。

> `[00:09:17]` It was like he was really Harring to think that people can have a stock such a salary out of college and you\'re gonna go like take not a great job that you\'re going to do something that\'s a little riskier.

`[00:09:17]` 他认为人们可以在大学毕业后就有这么高的薪水，而你却要去做一份不太好的工作，去做一些风险更大的事情，这就像他真的是在哈林(Harring)一样。

> It turns out and I mean don\'t quote me on this because your parents will kill me.

我的意思是不要引用我的话因为你父母会杀了我。

> It\'s all going to be fine.

一切都会好起来的。

> OK.

好的

> When I told my parents that I was going to go do a startup.

当我告诉我父母我要去做一家创业公司的时候。

> And I know we\'re all a bit older here.

我觉得这是个很好的观点。

你只需要知道，通过移动和学习，所有这一切加起来，总结你过去几年的经验，是什么使你喜欢明天的事情。

> That will be successful and it just takes trying and trying and trying again.

这将是成功的，它只需要尝试和再次尝试。

> I mean Instagram like filter\'s came from a photography class that I took in Florence or my my photography teacher gave me a square format camera called a hoga.

我的意思是 Instagram 就像过滤器一样，来自我在佛罗伦萨上的摄影课，或者我的摄影老师给了我一个叫做 Hoga 的方形相机。

这是一台塑料相机，它受到了潮人的欢迎，无论如何，他都把它递给了我，他说你应该用这个。

最初的想法，拉姆班开始渗出，像最初的样子，你是如何得到你的第一个联合创始人安葬，但我将回答一个稍微不同的问题，因为我有一个更好的故事，蒂拉。

我脑子里在想，我只是不知道如何制作 iPhone 应用程序，所以我会在五岁时笑出来。

> `[00:14:59]` So it worked out for me.

`[00:14:59]` 所以这件事为我解决了。

> `[00:15:02]` But that ended up being like really important for a development cycle was which was like we were able to iterate really really quickly and like launch new features because it was aged Hammell.

`[00:15:02]` 但这对开发周期来说是非常重要的，这就像我们能够非常快地迭代，就像发布新特性一样，因为它已经过时了。
